                  SeaSome's primary mission is to advocate for cleaner shores
                  and more sustainable living. Within this realm, users can
                  donate to SeaSome or attend excursions that last about 4 days
                  in extraordinary locations. The excursions are geared towards
                  photographers and their company. These opportunities allow for
                  a like-minded community to come together and see how beautiful
                  the world is, why it is worth saving and to capture its
                  enchantment.

                  current web.

                  and
                  <a href="https://oceana.org/" target="_blank">Oceana</a> are
                  only two of the many ocean-advocating organizations
                  maintaining sites with exceptional user experiences. SeaSome's
                  wireframes and palette were inspired from these sites. The
                  market gap of non-profit photography excursions towards
                  conservation was crystal clear. This allowed us to create an
                  atmosphere free of competition and expressive of the true
                  cause that SeaSome lives for.

                <p class="mb-5">
                  The palette of SeaSome is of course, hues of blue. Commonly
                  found on similar sites, the blue representing the ocean was a
                  no-brainer. Rather than going the route of Sea Legacy and
                  accenting it with it's complimentary color of orange, we found
                  that keeping consistent blues and black commended the site's
                  many images very well.

                    idea what was going on? You're not alone. Having an
                    explanatory, visual atmosphere can avoid the extremely
                    progressive over-design of some sites. Again, outside of
                    expeditions, SeaSome customer relationships are all virtual.
                    This lends weight on ensuring users can complete their tasks
                    and gather information they need from the site alone.

                <p>
                  Being the designer and developer, building mobile variants
                  came smoothly as I established the breakpoints. In common
                  cases where I would be handing off the designs to another
                  developer, I design mobile, web and sometimes tablet views.
                  <br /><br />
                  In summary, it was a very engaging and educational experience
                  as I pulled beautiful scenery, oceanic advocacy, marketing
                  strategy and virtual experiences into one set scene.
