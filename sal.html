                      Save a Life Pet Rescue is an organization in Central Florida that rescues dogs, puppies and cats from high-kill shelters, giving them a second chance at life with a loving family.
                      <br><br>
                      Since their formation in 2006, they have successfully rehabilitated, spayed/neutered, and placed over 15,000 animals with warm, loving families!

                      great market comparisons for the Save a Life site.
                      <br>
                      While the amount of content was not the same, interactions and sitemap hierarchy was better defined by running user tests on those sites.

                      List of components and features that made the analyzed sites successful.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><span class="significant">Simple naviagtion.</span> Not an overwhelming amount of links and clearly titled.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Imagery.</span> Specifically on the Humane Society's site, imagery plays a large role in capturing the emotion of the user. This is a technique often used by organizations that
                      wish to completely convey their message and mission to the user.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Simplicity.</span> The sites are rather simple and down to the point. A picture is worth a thousand words, so when images are used correctly, verbaige can take a wiser role.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Significant "DONATE" buttons.</span> The Humane Society's site displays an emphasized donate button in the top navigation as well as through out the site. This gives the user ample opportunity to opt a donation.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">"Give once or monthly" donations.</span> Providing a simple option to give once or monthly when donating put the user in clear control.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Single page "details" sections.</span> While analyzing the Shelter Project site, upon viewing the details of a specific dog, the extra text and images opens on the same page. This allows for a less extensive site map and quicker page load, giving the user
                      the informaion they are looking for immediately without losing their place in the search results.</li>

                    <p class="significant" style="font-weight:normal">
                      List of problematic featues and elements that interfered with the user experience.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><span class="significant">Too many directions.</span> The Human Society's homepage takes a lot of directions. Movement and flow are necessary to navigate a user through a page,
                      but the flow of information on that site page was uneven and sloppy. Consider the user path a hike from top to bottom...I would label this hike to be strenuous.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Color Theory.</span> Another flaw that also adds to the lack of organization on the homepage of teh Human Society site is the overuse of colors. Creating a specific palette would help this case. Also, monochromatically color the social icons will give
                      a more professional presentation rather than keeping them their actual colors.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Transition overlap.</span> While asyncronous loading is a very great thing, it can also overlap current content depending on the event called. The Shelter Project runs into this issue when opening detail panels. There is a
                      small timeframe where the panel is underneath the current content until the shift happens. Sometimes content can be loaded in a single space rather than pushing the current content down to make room.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Dated forms.</span> The Humane Society has a very modern site design. It's neat and professional and we land on a footer with a dated looking form. This form could be updated with a simple deletion of strokes and mobile notations so it can better be contingent with the rest of the beautiful site.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Keep the site accessible at all times.</span> There are a few instances on the Humane site where it directs the user to a PDF report in that same tab with no access back to the site except for the browser's back button. Relying on the browser to have tools that the site should have is a risk and the sitemap should reflect that. Opening the PDF in a new tab is a proper
                      solution here.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Use text wisely.</span> A paragraph of italicized, serif text is not the best of the eyes. Enough said.</li>

                  So, now that we have the do's and don'ts of our site and provided information from the client, our information architecture, sketching and wireframing can begin.
                  <br><br>
                  Firstly with multiple user flows in mind, I write out the sitemap and sketch board visions (these usually gain momentum in the virtual wireframing phase as seen below). Organzing the information on the site's pages in detail lets the client
                  visualize the data and revise any information errors - ensuring all of the information is covered and in qulity order.
                  <br><br>
                  I then work on the home page and gather proper style guide elements from there including fonts (no more than 2 or 3 styles), images, the palette, button/input styles and measurments.
                  <br><br>
                  An Agile workflow is a must as it always reverts back to the main subject - the user. After each phase of the design and development process, user testing is run to allow for errors or issues to be resolved in an efficient manner. It also
                  permits smooth transitions from the designers to the developers as they work together with changes and imporvements while perfecting the interface.
