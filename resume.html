             <p class="exp">
               <span>Project Managment</span><br><br>
               This past year alone I have lead and managed three major projects in teams of
               4 to 7 members. My organized, type A way of thinking enables me to meet dealines
               in a timely manner and PREcrastination is one of my golden rules. Finishing a
               product prior to its deadline allows for an elongated test/modify process and
               results in a quality interface with minimal errors. As a manager, I ensure each members'
               opinion and idea is recognized and processed with the end goal and user satisfaction as
               priority.
             </p>

             <p class="exp">
               <span>Logical Thinking</span><br><br>
               Logical processing that coincides with coding is what initially caught my interest.
               I have a desire to constantly connect the dots, decode issues and plug in potential
               successes.
             </p>

             <p class="exp">
               <span>Design</span><br><br>
               Essentially, it all started with design. By the age of 15 I began contracting
               professional graphic design jobs for organizations, businesses and individual clients.
               Ideally, I love the integrated field of coding and design. Digital design is the art
               form and coding is the medium.
              </p>

             <p class="exp">
               <span>Research</span><br><br>
               I have a psychology background specifiying in human factors and cognitive psych.
               The fortunate combination provides me with a better understanding of Human-Computer
               Interaction and its User-Centered Design methodology.
