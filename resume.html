               <h3>Project Managment</h3>
               <p>
                 This past year alone I have lead and managed three major projects in teams of
                 4 to 7 members. My organized, type A way of thinking enables me to meet dealines
                 in a timely manner and PREcrastination is one of my golden rules. Finishing a
                 product prior to its deadline allows for an elongated test/modify process and
                 results in a quality interface with minimal errors. As a manager, I ensure each members'
                 opinion and idea is recognized and processed with the end goal and user satisfaction as
                 priority.

             <div class="col-12 res">
               <h3>Logical Thinking</h3>
               <p>
                 Logical processing that coincides with coding is what initially caught my interest.
                 I have a desire to constantly connect the dots, decode issues and plug in potential
                 successes.

             <div class="col-12 res">
               <h3>Design</h3>
               <p>
                 Essentially, it all started with design. By the age of 15 I began contracting
                 professional graphic design jobs for organizations, businesses and individual clients.
                 Ideally, I love the integrated field of coding and design. Digital design is the art
                 form and coding is the medium.

               <h3>Research</h3>
               <p>
                 I have a psychology background specifiying in human factors and cognitive psych.
                 The fortunate combination provides me with a better understanding of Human-Computer
                 Interaction and its User-Centered Design methodology.
