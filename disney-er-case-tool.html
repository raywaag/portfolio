                Managing investigative cases and accomodation requests was a clunky, disconnected experience that made work difficult to track, produce, and connect. 
                This project was a mission to introduce the ideal product solution for the Employee Relations (ER) team that handled these cases on a daily bases.

              <h3 class="mb-2 mt-5">Employee Interviews & Feedback</h3>
              <p class="mb-3">
                The researcher and I conducted several 1-hour long usability studies observing employees use their current tool and competitor tools. 
                We listened and documented their concerns and needs to feed our efforts to design an intuitive and efficient case tool.

              <h4 class="mb-3 mt-2">🥲 Pain Points</h4>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Many employees we spoke with faced similar hardships when interacting with competitor tools or showing us their extremely over-calculated Excel spreadsheet forms. 
                The main points for me going into the design were:
              </p>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>
                  <strong>Disorientating Navigation</strong> - The additions of tabs throughout case
                  management affords unnecessary complexity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Too Many Fields</strong> - Case managers would like to see only what is
                  required to successfully manage the case.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Valueless Clicks</strong> - The amount of clicks to perform a task is a
                  constant area of concern.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Unfamiliar Verbiage</strong> - The nomenclature is foreign to the wording
                  case managers are used to.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Task Variation</strong> - Case managers found that there were too
                  many variations of completing a single task.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5">😎 Opportunities</h4>
              <p class="mb-3">
                It was almost a struggle keeping hold of all the opportunities I had coming out of these interviews. It was energizing and encouraging to carry them through 
                to the design phase. A few of the opportunities were:
              </p>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>
                  <strong>Streamline the Workflow</strong> - Render a linear mental model for case
                  management.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Profitable Clicks</strong> - Create an environment where every step
                  and/or click is beneficial to the case.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Clear Correlation</strong> - Make evident which claims are associated to
                  which party and outcome.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Efficient Real Estate</strong> - Make use of the screen’s space to effectively
                  display information and fields.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Desired Features</strong> - Case export, auto-save, pre-populated form
                  fields, and Outlook integration.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="mt-10">Market Analysis</h3>
              <p class="mb-3 mt-3">
                Interviewing employees gave us a lot of great insight into how these products work and features of current market competitors. As a team, we had to provide a 
                custom design that was the best at a level that made the return on investment worth it for Disney, rather than partnering with a vendor.

              <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3">Current Workflow</h3>
              <p>
                Watching employees interact with ServiceNow and Quickbase, I was able to map out the flow of 15 (FIFTEEN!!) clicks and numerous tabs and pages it took for 
                employees to do what they needed.
              </p>
              <img src="images/disney-er-tool/disney-er-current-workflow.png" alt="Current Sitemap" class="img-fluid mb-2 br" />

              <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Proposed Workflow</h3>
              <p>
                By designing an dynamic, single-page case management system, I reduced the time from case creation to case close down to 5 clicks. This is the power of automation and 
                giving users only what they need through targeting and logic.
              </p>
              <img src="images/disney-er-tool/disney-er-proposed-workflow.png" alt="Current Sitemap" class="img-fluid mb-2 br" />

              <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary mt-12">Designing</h1>
              <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Initial Prototype & Testing</h3>
              <p>
                We were able to follow-up with employees to test our newly-designed prototype. The interaction ad compactness of the design was extremely well recieved. 
                We did end up having to adjust for additional feature and targeting as the project manager finalized requirements.
              </p>

              <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary mt-12">Proposing the Experience</h1>
              <p>
                Once the design was finalized to meet employee <i>and</i> business needs, I presented the prototype and walked through the designs piece by piece to 
                ensure leadership understood the impact of the new experience.

              <!-- Case Submit -->
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-10">Submitting a Case</h2>
              <p>Before, submitting a case would happen manually and it was separate from the form. Case managers would need to create a case and input details into it as part of their job. 
                In the new experience, intake specialists would input all requests and reports into the same form and this would feed into the case management portal. There would be no more 
                duplicative efforts or miscommunications as everything would live in the same system. Accomodations could event be submitted by the employes themselves!

                 It was essentially a case managers virtual desk.

                The activity log was used to track notes and save them chronologically with the ability for the author to edit or delete them. These notes would 
                contain the author's name, date, and time of posting. These comments would save to the case record once closed.
