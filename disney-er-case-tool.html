                The process for managing investigative cases and accommodation requests was previously clunky and fragmented, making it
                difficult to track progress, generate outcomes, and connect related efforts. This project set out to deliver a
                streamlined, intuitive product solution tailored specifically for the Employee Relations (ER) team, who manage these
                cases on a daily basis.

              <p class="mb-5">
                Because I was new to the case creation and investigation process, this project relied heavily on employee feedback and
                firsthand insights. Before identifying product pain points and opportunities, I conducted interviews to deeply
                understand the workflows, challenges, and needs of those involved.
              </p>

              <h3 class="mb-2 mt-5">Employee Interviews & Feedback</h3>
              <p>
                The researcher and I conducted multiple one-hour usability sessions, observing employees as they interacted with both
                their current tool and competitor solutions. Throughout the sessions, we listened to their feedback, capturing
                key concerns and needs to inform the design of a more intuitive and efficient case management tool. We created three core personas 
                to represent key users through the redesign:<br/> An Intake Specialist, Case Manager, and VP (leaders)
              </p>

              <h4 class="mb-3 mt-2">🥲 Pain Points</h4>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Many of the employees we spoke with shared similar challenges when using competitor tools or managing overly complex
                Excel spreadsheets. With those insights in mind, my key priorities going into the design were:
              </p>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>
                  <strong>Disorientating Navigation</strong> - The additions of tabs throughout case
                  management affords unnecessary complexity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Too Many Fields</strong> - Case managers would like to see only what is
                  required to successfully manage the case.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Valueless Clicks</strong> - The amount of clicks to perform a task is a
                  constant area of concern.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Unfamiliar Verbiage</strong> - The nomenclature is foreign to the wording
                  case managers are used to.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Task Variation</strong> - Case managers found that there were too
                  many variations of completing a single task.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5">😎 Opportunities</h4>
              <p class="mb-3">
                It was almost overwhelming (in the best way) to keep track of all the opportunities that emerged from these interviews.
                The insights were both energizing and motivating as I transitioned into the design phase. A few key opportunities
                included:
              </p>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>
                  <strong>Streamline the Workflow</strong> - Render a linear mental model for case
                  management.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Profitable Clicks</strong> - Create an environment where every step
                  and/or click is beneficial to the case.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Clear Correlation</strong> - Make evident which claims are associated to
                  which party and outcome.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Efficient Real Estate</strong> - Make use of the screen’s space to effectively
                  display information and fields.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Desired Features</strong> - Case export, autosave, pre-populated form
                  fields, and Outlook integration.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="mt-10">Market Analysis</h3>
              <p class="mb-3 mt-3">
                Interviewing employees provided valuable insight into how these products function and the features offered by current
                market competitors. As a team, we aimed to deliver a custom design that not only outperformed existing solutions but
                also offered a return on investment that made it worthwhile for Disney to build in-house rather than partner with a
                vendor.
              </p>

              <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3">Current Workflow</h3>
              <p>
                By observing how employees interact with ServiceNow and Quickbase, I mapped out the workflow - requiring 15
                clicks to navigate through multiple tabs and pages in effort to complete a single task.
              </p>
              <img src="images/disney-er-tool/er-current-workflow.png" alt="Current Sitemap" class="img-fluid mb-2 br" />

              <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Proposed Workflow</h3>
              <p>
                By designing an dynamic, single-page case management system, I reduced the time from case creation to case closing down to 5 clicks. This is the power of automation and 
                giving users only what they need through targeting and logic.
              </p>
              <img src="images/disney-er-tool/er-proposed-workflow.png" alt="Current Sitemap" class="img-fluid mb-2 br" />

              <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary mt-12">Designing</h1>
              <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Initial Prototype & Testing</h3>
              <p>
                We were able to follow-up with employees to test our newly-designed prototype. The interaction ad compactness of the design was extremely well recieved! 
                We did end up having to adjust for additional features and targeting as the project manager finalized requirements.
              </p>

              <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary mt-12">Proposing the Experience</h1>
              <p>
                Once the design was finalized to meet employee <i>and</i> business needs, I presented the prototype and walked through the designs to 
                ensure leadership understood the impact of the new experience.

              <!-- Case Submit -->
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-10">Submitting a Case</h2>
              <p>Previously, submitting a case was a manual process and handled separately from the intake form. Case managers were
              responsible for creating and entering all case details themselves. With the new experience, intake specialists can now
              input all requests and reports directly into a single, unified form, which automatically feeds into the case management
              portal. This streamlined approach reduces duplicate work and minimizes the risk of miscommunication, as all information
              is now housed in one system. Additionally, employees will even have the ability to submit accommodation requests on
              their own!

              <p>The case dashboard served as the "homepage" for case managers. It provided a clear view of their current cases,
              statuses, and allowed them to create and manage tasks. In many ways, it functioned as a virtual desk, helping case
              managers stay organized and efficient in their daily work.

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-10">Case Management</h2>
              <p>The case management page was the hub where all key activities took place. Think of it as the digital “case file.” It
              contained important details about the case, notes from interviews, and information about the subject and witnesses. This
              is also where the final decision was submitted, marking the official closure of the case.

              <p>
                Certain case details, such as the Case Title, Case Number, Case Type(s), and Opened and Updated Dates, are determined
                automatically. Meanwhile, the case manager is responsible for managing the Status (e.g., Work in Progress, Cancelled,
                Closed), as well as options to delete the case and save changes, with an autosave feature running every 5 seconds to
                ensure no data is lost.

              <h5 class="mt-10">Incident & Accomodation Details</h5>
              <p>
                Cases were assigned by Case Managers after being submitted by Intake Specialists. The intake form provided key
                information such as the reporting channel, incident date and location, and a summary of the incident. Following
                resolution, additional details like the resolution date and any comments or notes were recorded to complete the case.

              <p>
                Party information includes the individual’s name, role (such as Subject, Witness, Complainant, or HR Business Partner),
                case history, and employee details. For production employees, additional information like the production company,
                distributor, show name, and location is recorded. If the party is identified as the subject, details regarding the case
                type, findings, and resolution type are also documented.

                The party case history is accessible through a modal view that is searchable and displays cases in a list format,
                including details such as case type(s), opened and closed dates, status, and involved parties. Employee details—sourced
                directly from HR—include name, PRNR, title, business unit, organization, leader, employee type, union status, and hire
                date. Additionally, work contact information like phone number, email, and address is provided for easy reference.

              <p>
                The notes log was used to track notes and save them chronologically with the ability for the author to edit or delete them. These notes would 
                contain the author's name, date, and time of posting. These comments would save to the case record once closed.

              <p>
                The Export Case Report feature allows users to download all case details and attachments bundled into a single .zip
                file. Keywords can be predefined, added, or removed, and are indexed to enhance search functionality. Attachments can be
                uploaded easily via drag-and-drop or file selection, with support for large file sizes. The attachments list is
                organized chronologically and categorized by upload type (such as interview notes, correspondence, emails, or
                summaries), along with the upload date. Users can download or delete attachments and view additional details by
                expanding or collapsing each item. Additionally, cases can be linked to related cases, with options to select, link, or
                remove these connections as needed.

              <p>
                The system distinguishes between read-only and actionable items. Read-only sections include static details, incident
                details, and case details, which cannot be edited. Actionable items available to users include exporting case reports,
                adding keywords, uploading and managing attachments, and linking correlating cases.

              <p>
                The Disney ER Case Tool revolutionized the Employee Relations case management process by transforming a fragmented,
                multi-step workflow into a streamlined, intuitive experience. Through user-centered design, the tool reduced case
                processing from 15 clicks to just five, minimized redundant data entry, and integrated essential features like
                autosave, keyword tagging, and Outlook synchronization. By aligning with employee needs and business objectives, this
                solution not only enhanced operational efficiency but also fostered a more cohesive and user-friendly environment for
                case managers and intake specialists alike.
