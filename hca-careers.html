                <p class="mb-5">
                  With nearly 800k visitors a month, the HCA Healthcare careers site wasn't just in for a makeover. The UX team (us, hi!) was contacted to 
                  help reconstruct the experience as a whole. What do visitors wish to achieve? How do they feel? How intuitive is 
                  the current state of the site and how can we improve that? What is the current experience of scouting a career in healthcare?
                  <br/><br/>
                  We started from square one by receiving input and ratings from stakeholders, examining
                  heatmaps, analyzing competitor sites and establishing key personas. From there came brainstorming through a collaborative and caffeine-induced design session, 
                  multiple 2-hour wireframing jams with our core team and usability testing the wireframe prototypes. With our design system and feedback from the tests, we started to 
                  simultaneously build out the site UI, adding content as it was received. "App stack" templates formed, our design system code library was audited, kicking off our accessibility refactor, the Talent Acquisition team 
                  was 100% communicative and the project was constantly full-steam ahead. It was a thrill and I encourage you to confirm this brief summary with the goods and details below! 
                </p>

                <h2 class="mb-3">My Roles</h2>

                <p class="mt-4">
                  That said, I owe a huge shout out to my team who handled the work outside of the above list like our UX Researcher's rocking
                  research &
                  usability testing skills to empower the designs and my Co-Creator's overall energy assisting in interviews, user flows and
                  pushing my designs outside of my comfort zone.
                  <br /><br />
                  I never want to give off the notion that any one person can pull off a project of this scale. It took a village
                  including our partners in the project over on the Talent Acquisition side. The appreciation I have for this team and
                  all
                  of the deliverables we plated throughout the process cannot be expressed in words.
                  <br /><br />
                  Mind you, this project was in the midst of COVID-19. I hope you are reading this at least months from now and we
                  recovered okay. Regardless, this team proved that there, as Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell put it, really ain’t no
                  mountain high
                  enough to keep us from killing it on the UX dance floor.

                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Problem Statement</h2>
                <p class="mb-3">
                  Going into the project we faced a few pre-determined pain points. These were reiterated during stakeholder interviews, researched in competitor analyses and strongly emphasized throughout the project timeline.  
                </p>
                <ul class="mt-3">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Employee Value Proposition (EVP)</strong> needs to be clear and emphasized
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The site should build <strong>trust and confidence</strong> with the user by <strong>incorporating brand</strong> strategy and neighborly content

                  <li>
                    <strong>Engage</strong> the candidates with the user experience and architecture of the site
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The site should be <strong>intuitive and conversion-focused</strong>
                  </li>

                    <strong>Zero to one click job search</strong> with accommodating filter options

                <p><strong>Stakeholder Interviews</strong></p>
                <p class="mb-5">
                  Internal stakeholder interviews were held to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT)
                  regarding site functionality, design and performance. External job seekers were surveyed as well to help inform the
                  current experience of the careers site.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Many of the stakeholders we reached out to we eventually met at our design session to gather their words into sketches,
                  heatmaps and fun! From the business, marketing and experience side of the Talent Acquisition team, we were able to
                  document insights from the professionals who this Careers site leans on.

                    Use of videos is too limited and there should be more

                  <li>
                    Talent Network is vague and ill-used

                    There is a lot of valuable content but it should be streamlined within a single purpose

                    Promote the culture and EVP more through real imagery, testimonials and social media feeds

                  <li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Current usability</strong> of the site: <strong>3.1</strong> due to search glitches, long page loads, and the talent network ambiguity
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Current site structure</strong>: <strong>3.1</strong> due to lengthy top navigation link verbiage, the lack of landing page CTAs, inability to
                    search for multiple cities/locations at once and the journey of reaching a job posting in over 4 clicks.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Current content</strong>: <strong>2.8</strong> since the videos could be more present, career programs are too underrated, and more trust could be
                    built with testimonials, GlassDoor links in the footer social icons and real imagery.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Visual design</strong>: <strong>2.6</strong> from its outdated appeal, “cold hand” images, too few lifestyle imagery, and extremely wordy pages.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="mb-2 mt-5">Current visitor behavior</h3>
                  <p>
                    We analyzed CrazyEgg heatmaps of our landing and job search pages and noted a few immediate follies in the current
                    site.
                  </p>
                  <ul class="mb-3">

                      Searching by Job Number was not a popular search method

                      Filters were interacted with less and less as the user traveled down the page with the hottest touchpoint being “Show

                  <h3 class="mb-2 mt-5">Personas & Journey Mapping</h3>
                  <p>
                    Defining target audiences helped us make specific design decisions and propose the site’s new information architecture
                    . During our journey mapping and storyboarding processes, we used our nursing persona to mapped the many different ways 
                    an incoming nurse would perform a task from point A to B to C.
                  </p>

                  <p class="mt-5"><strong>Storyboarding and User Journeys</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    We constructed main task flows via sketched storyboards and an interface-facing (what a word) user flow. Using the
                    interface screenshots to show what the user was interacting with during each step in the flow helped us identify the
                    areas of poor engagement, information and the unfortunate amount of clicks it took to complete the task.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Aside from being visually adorable, the sketched storyboard allowed us to recognize the overarching journey from point A
                    to point B contributing less to the emotion of the task and more towards the steps taken to achieve it.

                  </p>
                  <img
                  src="images/hca-careers/job-app.jpg"

                  class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-5"

                <p class="mt-5"><strong>Journey Maps</strong></p>
                <p>
                  What does a user do, see, hear and feel during a specific task? In this case, we used persona Maria Delgado to help walk
                  us through the emotional journey of attending a job fair, applying for a job and awaiting an interview.

                <h3 class="mt-5">Competitor Analysis</h3>
                <p class="mb-5 mt-3">
                  We addressed a list of competitors provided by our main POC from the Talent Acquisition team as well as a
                  few extras. They were analyzed under buckets that I like to call “Keep” (features we should pull for inspiration),
                  “Improve” (features that we should look into and modify for success) and “Remove” (good examples of what not to do
                  on our site). Along with these key takeaways, I rated each competitor site for how they handled the pain points
                  mentioned above and a few biography facts of each company so we’d have a sense of who they were, their size and their
                  audience.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Some sites that we looked into were Adidas, Pinterest, AdventHealth, Amazon, Comcast, Tenet Health, LinkedIn and fellow
                  Talemetry clients RBS, JC Penny and Ascension.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-2">
                  We analyzed the following key features of our competitors and these are the conclusions we gathered:

                    opportunities throughout the entire site journey.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Filtering</strong>: above-the-content filtering like LinkedIn can free up horizontal real estate of the page. Also allowing for
                    multiple filters and clear active filters during the job search.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Personalization</strong>: basing a job search “by your interests” as a user and having the ability to save jobs without logging
                    in enhanced the experience we saw in some of our competitors. Also including features like a thoughtful chatbot made the
                    job hunting journey more intimate.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Culture & EVP display</strong>: sites that ranked higher in these areas included testimonials and authentic videos and imagery on
                    the site. Designing an engaging employee benefits page and presenting employee reviews increased trust of these
                    companies.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="mt-5">Pattern Analysis</h3>
                <p class="mt-3 mb-3">
                  Along with the competitor analysis, a pattern analysis was administered to address any successful components, app stacks
                  and layouts of current career sites. This served as a great reference during our wireframe sessions and also helped our
                  partners voice ideas about the careers site’s end goal.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Our initial pattern analysis companies were those built on the Talemetry platform, since that was the platform we were
                  going to be building upon.
                  <br /><br />
                  We looked into the landing pages, job listings, navigation structures, EVP presentations, location listings and job descriptions of our competitors.
                </p>
                <img src="images/hca-careers/pattern-analysis-horiz.jpg" alt="Pattern Analysis" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-5 pl-2 pr-2" />
                <p class="mb-3"><strong>What we learned from this:</strong></p>
                <ul class="mt-3 mb-3">
                  <li>
                    The “feel” of the company relies on that initial landing page impression and it serves as the fork in the road leading
                    out to the rest of the site. Include engaging content and meaningful call-to-actions on this page.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Two-Panel view for the job listings page works well by displaying the description to the right and filters above
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Group locations by region, state or country to shorten the list
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Include search consistently in the top navigation
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Use short and concise navigation labels
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Do not underestimate the power of testimonials
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The three main CTAs on the job description page are “Apply”, “Save” and “View related jobs”
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Proposing a new sitemap</h3>
                <p><strong>Current Sitemap</strong></p>
                <img src="images/hca-careers/current-sitemap.jpg" alt="Current Sitemap" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-5 pl-5 pr-5" />
                <p>
                  Building out the current sitemap set the tone and empowered us even more to challenge the site’s current structure. The
                  results of the current sitemap emphasized the lack of organization of the main navigation’s “buckets” as well as the
                  lack of prominence regarding everything HCA Healthcare has to offer such as their candidate programs, residencies,
                  outreach and more.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-5"><strong>Proposed Sitemap</strong></p>
                <img src="images/hca-careers/proposed-sitemap.jpg" alt="Proposed Sitemap" class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-5 pl-5 pr-5" />
                <p>
                  Our new sitemap suggested changing the verbiage of the top nav links and adding in a programs tab. Also, we addressed
                  the lack of logistics amongst the categories by, for example, breaking down Locations into United States and United
                  Kingdom sub-pages and moving the Military & Veterans underneath the newly-formed Programs tab...and then some.
                  <br/><br/>
                  We used <a href="https://www.gloomaps.com/" target="_blank">GlooMaps</a> to create our proposed map. Our partners were able to come in and make notes, link to other pages and modify the map, offering a wonderfully collaborative experience.

                <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Wireframing</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                  During multiple InVision Freehand sessions, the four of us constructed and brainstormed the wireframes for our new
                  careers site based on all of the work we had done thus far.
                </p>

                <img src="images/hca-careers/wires-events.png" alt="Events Wireframes" class="img-fluid mb-5" />
                <p class="mb-5">
                  Once we built our wireframes out, they were prototyped and hooked up to InVision to be tested.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Usability Testing the Wireframes</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                From the wireframes alone, we received quality feedback on the job search and landing page experiences in which we took
                into consideration when designing the site UI. We also gained a few trust-worthy user testers to carry over to the
                High-Fidelity tests we’d administer later on.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3"><strong>Job Search</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Iconography; pointing out Google specifically, multiple users requested that their be icons alongside the details in job
                  listing items like placing a briefcase next to the shift and a clock alongside the post date
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3"><strong>Landing Page</strong></p>
                <ul class="mt-3 mb-3">
                  <li>
                    Add call-to-actions to some of the EVP content to bring meaning and purpose to them and avoid the marketing and
                    advertising premonition.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We included a graphical stats bar and received feedback that it, again, sounded too boastful and interaction would help.
                    Including a map was suggested.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Move the interviews and testimonial videos higher up on the page.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Developer feedback from Talemetry</h3>
                <p>
                  While we love to design to the nines and let the creativity flow, reality does set in as the deployment deadline
                  approaches. The Talemetry developer was helpful enough to give feedback in a timely manner during our wireframe phase.
                  He gave us important back-end restrictions such as where certain data can and cannot be pulled and displayed and the
                  separated database for Events and Jobs.
                </p>

                <h1 class="mb-4" style="color:rgb(80, 171, 181); margin-top:140px;">High-Fidelity Prototypes</h1>
                <p class="mt-5"><strong>Leveraging HCA's design system we brought our research and ideation to life!</strong></p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                  HCA Healthcare’s design system, Neutron, that which I help build, document and develop, was implemented into our Careers
                  High-Fidelity designs. Over a two-week hustle we were able to bring our wireframes to life and link up a prototype to
                  present to our partners and more user testing.
                  We also prototyped a mobile-approach to the careers site and that experience as well.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-5"><strong>Usability Testing the UI Designs</strong></p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                  Usability tests were conducted through UserTesting.com and covered primary flows like the homepage experience, searching
                  for a job and the events flow. The results were expansive and helped us take the final sprint of the project to solidify
                  the experience and interfaces.
                  <br/><br/>
                  To ensure the user’s journey was as appropriately emotional as desktop, we tested mobile as well with the notion that a
                  mobile user is anticipating a browsing experience while a desktop user is more likely to invest efforts to apply for a
                  job.
                  <br /><br />
                  Much of the feedback pertained to emphasizing certain actions to stand out more and reconfiguring the landing page to 
                  include more emotion and trust with less "marketing jargon".
                </p>

                <p class="mt-5"><strong>Modifications & Content</strong></p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                  The careers site was to use <a href="https://www.talemetry.com/" target="_blank">Talemetry</a> as its CMS. That meant that every page should be templated out with “app stacks”.
                  These are column patterns to be used and populated accordingly on different pages. An example of an app stack would be a
                  two-column lock-up with a header and text on one side and video on the other. Another would be a header pattern that can
                  be reused on multiple pages. Or an icon bar with a set of icons with headers, text and links. All of these represent a
                  meager portion of our finalized app stack library.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Near the end of the last two sprints, our Talent Acquisition partners provided us with content and specified which app
                  stack they’d like to use. It was really great to see the puzzle pieces of this project come together so well in the end.
                </p>

                <h1 class="mb-4" style="color:rgb(80, 171, 181); margin-top:120px;">Design-Development Handoff</h1>
                <h5 class="mb-3 mt-5">Design System Hand-Off & Accessibility Auditing</h5>
                <p class="mb-2">
                  With the development phase right around the corner, we had to warrant that our not-yet-released design system was ready
                  to withstand an external-facing site. This meant not only clean and functional code, but with greater emphasis it meant
                  having AA accessibility compliance.
                  <br/><br/>
                  We handed the code library over to our Accessibility Subject Matter Expert (SME) for a thorough audit. The design system
                  was in great need of some accessibility TLC so I graciously accepted the dense audit results. One week later the code
                  kit was ready and delivered to our Talemetry developer as the final tool to liven up the high-fidelities.
                  <br /><br />
                  Like most cases, the hand-off is never as smooth as you'd hope. But with the amazing collaborative effort of the entire team, we were able 
                  to efficiently communicate with the developer and answer any questions he ran into along the way. 
                  <br/><br/>
                  It's important in these moments to avoid taking 
                  any feedback personally because in the end it's the product that shows the damage that would inflict. 
                  Only minor changes remained from that point on and it was a bittersweet end to a speechlessly amazing project.
