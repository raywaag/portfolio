                With nearly 800k visitors a month, the HCA Healthcare careers
                site wasn't just in for a makeover. The UX team (us, hi!) was
                contacted to help reconstruct the digital experience as a whole.
                What do visitors wish to achieve? How do they feel? How
                intuitive is the current state of the site and how can we
                improve that? What is the current experience of scouting a
                career in healthcare?

                Our problem statement signifies key ideas that were top of mind

                the us direction when administering market analyses, stakeholder

                We met with a variety of stakeholders who are involved with HCA
                Heathcare’s recruiting and marketing efforts. With nearly
                unanimous feedback, we collected information on the key personas
                (main site users), high-level objectives, current pros/cons of
                the site, ease of use, competitors to watch and site ratings.

                <li>
                  <strong>Current site structure</strong>:
                  <strong>3.1</strong> due to lengthy top navigation link
                  verbiage, the lack of landing page CTAs, inability to search
                  for multiple cities/locations at once and the journey of
                  reaching a job posting in over 4 clicks.

                <li>
                  <strong>Current content</strong>: <strong>2.8</strong> since
                  the videos could be more present, career programs are too
                  underrated, and more trust could be built with testimonials,
                  GlassDoor links in the footer social icons and real imagery.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Visual design</strong>: <strong>2.6</strong> from its
                  outdated appeal, “cold hand” images, too few lifestyle
                  imagery, and extremely wordy pages.

                This was due to searching being the site’s primary action and
                also because the design “below the fold” wasn’t as engaging as
                it could be. Nothing was screaming for attention (yet). See
                below just how hot those search fields are compared to the rest

              <h3 class="mb-2 mt-5">Personas & Journey Mapping</h3>
              <p>
                When configuring new site architecture, design intention and
                substantiation, it’s essential to identify the key personas. In
                this case, the Careers site’s personas were
                <strong
                  >candidates, incoming nurses, internal transfers, students,
                  recruiters, casual job seekers and executive leaders</strong
                >. <br /><br />
                This list may seem long but typically there are a few handfuls
                of users to account for within a site. While they may encompass
                a large variety of personality and roles,
                <strong
                  >it’s important to define their intentions when navigating the
                  Careers site</strong
                >. Enter journey mapping.
              </p>

              <p class="mt-5"><strong>Journey Mapping</strong></p>
              <p>
                We constructed main task flows via sketched storyboards and an
                interface-facing (what a word) user flow. Using the interface
                screenshots to show what the user was interacting with during
                each step in the flow
                <strong
                  >helped us identify the areas of poor engagement, information
                  and the unfortunate amount of clicks it took to complete the
                  task</strong
                >.
              </p>
              <img

                class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-3 br"
              />
              <p class="mb-5">
                Journey maps walk alongside a key persona as they go through the
                motions to complete a task. We identify every step the user may
                take and what emotions they are experiencing in each instance.
                This helped us capture the current emotional state of the
                website, where any unsatisfactory moments occur and why.
              </p>

              <p class="mt-5"><strong>Storyboarding</strong></p>
              <p>
                Using hand-drawn illustrations and actual screen views, we
                constructed the journeys of different tasks.
                <strong
                  >The number of clicks, steps, points of confusion and overall
                  flow can be accounted for in the storyboard results</strong
                >.

              <h3 class="mt-5">Competitor Analysis</h3>
              <p class="mb-5 mt-3">
                In order to establish site architecture, design or proposition,
                we looked to the current market of careers sites. This included
                <strong>24 competitors and other big-name companies</strong>
                that may offer some insight -
                <strong
                  >AdventHealth, Ascension, Tenet Health, United, JC Penny, RBS,
                  Comcast, Amazon and many more</strong
                >. <br /><br />
                In this analysis we discovered how other companies answered our
                problem statement attributes, site strengths (what to do), site
                weaknesses (what not to do) and copy writing including images
                and videos. We also captured different design patterns we found
                inspiring such as job search methods, locations, landing page
                designs and site personability portrayals.

                  a navigation tab, keep it front and center by promoting search
                  opportunities throughout the entire site journey.

                <li>
                  <strong>Filtering</strong>: above-the-content filtering like
                  LinkedIn can free up horizontal real estate of the page. Also
                  allowing for multiple filters and clear active filters during
                  the job search.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Personalization</strong>: basing a job search “by your
                  interests” as a user and having the ability to save jobs
                  without logging in enhanced the experience we saw in some of
                  our competitors. Also including features like a thoughtful
                  chatbot made the job hunting journey more intimate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Culture & EVP display</strong>: sites that ranked
                  higher in these areas included testimonials and authentic
                  videos and imagery on the site. Designing an engaging employee
                  benefits page and presenting employee reviews increased trust
                  of these companies.

                After all the above research, it was time to layout a plan of
                action for our own HCA Healthcare Careers site. This started
                with the information architecture. At a very high level we had
                to decide what the primary paths of the site needed to be and
                the paths they created.

                session to collaborate with the Talent Acquisition team on
                different ideas for this new site. Lots of ideas pitched and
                coffee consumed.

              <p class="mb-2">
                Using InVision Freehand as our flavor of choice, we brainstormed
                wireframe sketches. The initial design of the careers site was
                starting to reveal itself.
              </p>

              <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Usability Testing the Wireframes</h3>
              <p class="mb-2">
                Once the wires were sketched, we prototyped them to react just
                as a normal site would. This gave us the opportunity to gather
                real user feedback on the flow and function of the site rather
                than design.
                <br /><br />
                We not only gained useful insight on what users expected
                throughout their job search experience, but we also shared this
                prototype with our front-end developer at
                <a href="https://www.talemetry.com/" target="_blank"
                  >Talemetry</a
                >. He was able to give us direction of features that may not be
                achievable in the Talemetry environment and other notes to be
                cautious of when going into the high-fidelity designs.

              <p class="mb-2">
                After refining the wireframes based on notes received, the
                transition to a high-fidelity prototype was smoother and
                welcomed with confidence as we implemented HCA Healthcare’s
                Design System, Neutron, to build out the interface. It was
                remarkable watching all of the hard work congregate into a
                central design.

                <br />
                About 7 months post-launch, the HR & Talent team came back to the UXCOE with a problem. Essentially, there was a lack of 
                turn over on the job posting pages. Candidates would arrive, look around and then leave. A Crazy Egg heat map analysis showed little interaction 
                on the page with cool spots over the "Apply" and "Back to Jobs" buttons. Likewise, a browser test showed the job pages performing at 6% (out of 100%) due to 
                unused code and cached assets.

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Pattern Analysis</h2>
              <img src="images/hca-careers/pattern-analysis.png" alt="Careers Desktop Mock" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-4 br" />
              <p>Next, we looked at competitors (as seen in the nondescript image above). Identifying different job types like nursing, IT, ancillary support, executive roles etc. we 
              analyzed 41 competitors job postings. Below are the most common patterns we saw.</p>
                  <ul class="mt-3 mb-5">
                    <li>2-column organization</li>
                    <li>Right-handed content used for additions like videos, similar jobs, FAQs, quotes, and job details</li>
                    <li>Linked call-outs under the job posting to employee benefits and about us pages</li>
                    <li>Generic images on the posting page</li>
                    <li>Link for current employees was apparent</li>
                    <li>Iconography</li>
                    <li>96% of competitor job posting did not include benefits within the description</li>
                  </ul>


            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Wireframing Solutions</h2>
            <img src="images/hca-careers/wireframes.png" alt="Careers Desktop Mock" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-4 br" />
            <p>On a brisk Friday morning we jumped at the opportunity to swarm a wireframe session. We drafted A LOT of screens for A LOT of different jobs. 
              Along the way, we considered the pattern research, user feedback and main issues with the page. We made sure our wireframes included and accompanied the following.
            </p>
                <ul class="mt-3 mb-3">
                  <li>Maximized our <strong>2-column layout</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Video within the job posting moved</strong> to right column</li>
                  <li>Job details placed in header and in right column <strong>supported by iconography</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>About the company moved</strong> to the right column, out of the job description</li>
                  <li><strong>Top 3 similar jobs</strong> posted in right column</li>
                  <li><strong>Content reordered</strong> to meet candidate priorities</li>
                  <li><strong>EEO moved ot right column</strong> so it wasn't missed from any job postings</li>
                  <li><strong>Links embedded into job descriptions</strong> navigate to employee benefits page and facility location page (if applicable)</li>
                </ul>


            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">A, B and C Testing</h2>
            <p>After receiving a great response from the wireframe work, we drafted hi-fidelity designs. Three different header patterns made the final cut so we sent them off to 
              be judges with real eyes. Design A had large CTA buttons on the right, Design B had the buttons on the left with the rest of the content, and Design C leveraged 
              a generic image on the right side of the header.
              <br><br>
              The final consensus resulted in <strong class="text-white">78% votes towards Design A</strong>. This pattern was most similar to the one we currently planned for, so the developer was in good spirits!
            </p>

            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Results</h2>
            <p>Three months after this research and design effort, we received positive analytics on the updated job posting page.
            </p>
            <ul class="mt-3 mb-3">
              <li><strong class="text-white">72%</strong> increase in page traffic</li>
              <li><strong class="text-white">23%</strong> longer page time average</li>
              <li><strong class="text-white">2 times</strong> faster page loads</li>
              <li><strong class="text-white">Consistent, flat</strong> bounce rate</li>
