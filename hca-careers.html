                <p class="mb-5">
                  Save the Sea Turtles Foundation is a non-profit organization founded on Florida’s coast in 1987 aimed to support students, professionals and academic research efforts in the world of Marine Biology. With a specialization in sea turtles other marine life like sharks and jellyfish are also under their research umbrella.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Their mission and impact on our waters is incredibly powerful while their <a href="http://savetheseaturtle.org/default.html" target="_blank">current website</a> lacked this emotion. Especially since the foundation collects donations, runs a store and a membership program all from their website, it was due for a major refactor.

                  That said, I owe a huge shout out to my team who handled the work outside of the above list like Cyd’s rocking
                  research &
                  usability testing skills to empower the designs and Cora’s overall energy assisting in interviews, user flows and
                  pushing my designs outside of my comfort zone.
                  <br /><br />
                  I never want to give off the notion that any one person can pull off a project of this scale. It took a village
                  including our partners in the project over on the Talent Acquisition side. The gratification I have for this team and
                  all
                  of the deliverables we plated throughout the process cannot be expressed in words.
                  <br /><br />
                  Mind you, this project was in the midst of COVID-19. I hope you are reading this at least months from now and we
                  recovered okay. Regardless, this team proved that there, as Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell put it, really ain’t no
                  mountain high
                  enough to keep us from killing it on the UX dance floor.

                <p class="mb-3">
                  Going into the project we faced a few pre-determined pain points. These were reiterated during stakeholder interviews, researched in competitor analyses and were strongly emphasized throughout the project timeline.  
                </p>
                <ul class="mt-3">
                  <li>

                  <li>
                    The site should build <strong>trust and confidence</strong> with the user by <strong>incorporating brand</strong> strategy and neighborly content.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Engage</strong> the candidates with the user experience and architecture of the site.

                <p class="mb-5">
                  Internal stakeholder interviews were held to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT)
                  regarding site functionality, design and performance. External job seekers were surveyed as well to help inform the
                  current experience of the careers site.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Many of the stakeholders we reached out to we eventually met at our design session to gather their words into sketches,
                  heatmaps and fun! From the business, marketing and experience side of the Talent Acquisition team, we were able to
                  document insights from the professionals who this Careers site leans on.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Current site structure</strong>: <strong>3.1</strong> due to lengthy top navigation link verbiage, the lack of landing page CTAs, inability to

                  <p>
                    Defining target audiences helped us make specific design decisions and propose the site’s new information architecture
                    map. A key persona throughout the project was a nurse. During our journey mapping and storyboarding processes, we used
                    this nursing persona to conjure the many different ways an incoming nurse would perform a task from point A to B to C.
                  </p>

                  <p class="mt-5"><strong>Storyboarding and User Journeys</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    We constructed main task flows via sketched storyboards and an interface-facing (what a word) user flow. Using the
                    interface screenshots to show what the user was interacting with during each step in the flow, helped us identify the
                    areas of poor engagement, information and the unfortunate amount of clicks it took to complete the task.
                    <br/><br/>
                    And aside from being visually adorable, the sketched storyboard helps us recognize the overarching journey from point A
                    to point B contributing less to the emotion of the task and more towards the steps taken to achieve it.

                  What does a user do, see, hear and feel during a specific task? In this case, we used persona Maria Delgado to help walk
                  us through the emotional journey of attending a job fair, applying for a job and awaiting an interview.

                <h3 class="mt-5">Competitor Analysis</h3>
                <p class="mb-5 mt-3">
                  We addressed a list of competitors provided by Katherine, our main POC from the Talent Acquisition team, as well as a
                  few extras. They were analyzed under buckets that I like to call “Keep” (features we should pull for inspiration),
                  “Improve” (features that we should look into and modify to be successful) and “Remove” (good examples of what not to do
                  on our site). Along with these key takeaways, I rated each competitor site for how they handled the pain points
                  mentioned above and a few biography facts of each company so we’d have a sense of who they were, their size and their
                  audience.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Some sites that we looked into were Adidas, Pinterest, AdventHealth, Amazon, Comcast Tenet Health, LinkedIn and fellow
                  Telemetry clients like RBS, JC Penny and Ascension.
                </p>

                <span style="color:#888;font-size:0.95em;">Key Market Analysis Takeaways</span>
                <p class="mt-2">
                  We analyzed the following key features of our competitors and these are the conclusions we gained:
                </p>
                <ul class="mt-3">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Searchability</strong>: do not hide the search behind a navigation tab, keep it front and center by promoting search
                    opportunities throughout the entire site journey.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Filtering</strong>: above-the-content filtering like LinkedIn can free up horizontal real estate of the page. Also allowing for
                    multiple filters and clear active filters during the job search.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Personalization</strong>: basing a job search “by your interests” as a user and having the ability to save jobs without logging
                    in enhanced the experience we saw in some of our competitors. Also including features like a thoughtful chatbot made the
                    job hunting journey more intimate.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Culture & EVP display</strong>: sites that ranked higher in these areas included testimonials and authentic videos and imagery on
                    the site. Designing an engaging employee benefits page and presenting employee reviews increased trust of these
                    companies.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="mt-5">Pattern Analysis</h3>
                <p class="mt-3">
                  Along with the competitor analysis, a pattern analysis was administered to address any successful components, app stacks
                  and layouts of current career sites. This served as a great reference during our wireframe sessions and also helped our
                  partners voice ideas about the careers site’s end goal.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Our initial pattern analysis companies were those built on the Telemetry platform, since that was the platform we were
                  going to be building upon.
                  <br /><br />
                  We looked into the landing pages, job listings, navigation structures, EVP presentations, location listings and job descriptions of our competitors.
                </p>
                <img src="images/hca-careers/pattern-analysis-horiz.jpg" alt="Pattern Analysis" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-5 pl-5 pr-5" />
                <p class="mb-3"><strong>What we learned from this:</strong></p>
                <ul class="mt-3 mb-3">
                  <li>
                    The “feel” of the company relies on that initial landing page impression and it serves as the fork in the road leading
                    out to the rest of the site. Include engaging content and meaningful call-to-actions on this page.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Two-Panel view for the job listings page works well by displaying the description to the right and filters above
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Group locations by region, state or country to shorten the list
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Include search consistently in the top navigation
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Use short and concise navigation labels
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Do not underestimate the power of testimonials
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The three main CTAs on the job description page are “Apply”, “Save” and “View related jobs”
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Proposing a new sitemap</h3>
                <p><strong>Current Sitemap</strong></p>
                <img src="images/hca-careers/current-sitemap.jpg" alt="Pattern Analysis" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-5 pl-5 pr-5" />
                <p>
                  Building out the current sitemap set the tone and empowered us even more to challenge the site’s current structure. The
                  results of the current sitemap emphasized the lack of organization of the main navigation’s “buckets” as well as the
                  lack of prominence regarding everything HCA Healthcare has to offer such as their candidate programs, residencies,
                  outreach and more.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-5"><strong>Proposed Sitemap</strong></p>
                <img src="images/hca-careers/proposed-sitemap.jpg" alt="Pattern Analysis" class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-5 pl-5 pr-5" />
                <p>
                  Our new sitemap suggested changing the verbiage of the top nav links and adding in a programs tab. Also, we addressed
                  the lack of logistics amongst the categories by, for example, breaking down Locations into United States and United
                  Kingdom sub-pages and moving the Military & Veterans underneath the newly-formed Programs tab...and then some.
                  <br/><br/>
                  We used <a href="https://www.gloomaps.com/" target="_blank">GlooMaps</a> to create our proposed map. Our partners were able to come in and make notes, link to other pages and modify the map, offering a wonderfully collaborative experience.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Wireframing</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                  During multiple InVision Freehand sessions, the four of us constructed and brainstormed the wireframes for our new
                  careers site based on all of the work we had done thus far.
                </p>
                <img src="images/hca-careers/wires-locations.png" alt="Locations Wireframes" class="img-fluid mb-5" />
                <img src="images/hca-careers/wires-events.png" alt="Events Wireframes" class="img-fluid mb-5" />
                <p class="mb-5">
                  Once we built them out, they were prototyped and hooked up to InVision to be tested.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Usability Testing the Wireframes</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                From the wireframes alone, we received quality feedback on the job search and landing page experiences in which we took
                into consideration when designing the site UI. We also gained a few trust-worthy user testers to carry over to the
                High-Fidelity tests we’d administer later on.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-5"><strong>Job Search</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Iconography; pointing out Google specifically, multiple users requested that their be icons alongside the details in job
                  listing items like placing a briefcase next to the shift and a clock alongside the post date
                </p>
                <p class="mt-5"><strong>Landing Page</strong></p>
                <ul class="mt-3 mb-3">
                  <li>
                    Add call-to-actions to some of the EVP content to bring meaning and purpose to them and avoid the marketing and
                    advertising premonition.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We included a graphical stats bar and received feedback that it, again, sounded too boastful and interaction would help.
                    Including a map was suggested.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Move the interviews and testimonial videos higher up on the page.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Developer feedback from Talemetry</h3>
                <p>
                  While we love to design to the nines and let the creativity flow, reality does set in as the deployment deadline
                  approaches. The Telemetry developer was helpful enough to give feedback in a timely manner during our wireframe phase.
                  He gave us important back-end restrictions such as where certain data can and cannot be pulled and displayed and the
                  separated database for Events and Jobs.

                  HCA Healthcare’s design system, Neutron, that which I help build, document and develop, was implemented into our Careers
                  High-Fidelity designs. Over a two-week hustle we were able to bring our wireframes to life and link up a prototype to
                  present to our partners and more user testing.
                  We also prototyped a mobile-approach to the careers site and that experience as well.
