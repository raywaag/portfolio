            The process of searching, discovering and reaching out to a service dog organization can be a complex,
             broad and uneasy journey. Paws With A Purpose is available to create a friendly, navigable environment for veterans to
             better understand and find organizations that are most suitable to them and their disabilities.

      <h1>Workflow</h1>
      	<h5 class="text-left">Research</h5>
        	<p>
            Research was heavily invested in service dog organizations and their specifics to better customize PWAP. This allowed
            the team to develop pathways specialized to the user's disabilty type. Our biggest market competitor is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nagdu-guide-service-dog-info/id916496159?mt=8" target="_blank">NAGDU Guide & Service Dog Info</a>. We were
            able to analyze what aspects of the app they did well and what the user reviews liked / disliked about their app. Other service dog
            applications were accused of being falsified, leaving us a great gap in the market.
            <br>
            A big issue NAGDU Guide & Service Dog Info faced was interface appearance. There really was no graphical influence to their
            sitemap which allowed us a chance enhance our app.
            <br>
            Also, PWAP is an app specifically for veterans, therefore, our audience is very select allowing us to focus on catering to them and them only.

          	<p>
              We used yellows and blues to achieve our friendliness and patriotic envirnment. We did not want to straightforwardly use
               red, white and blue. We found that yellow paired well with the brighter blues and help a professional stance.
               <br>
               As our primary audience is above the age of 35 years, big fonts and icons were designed to increase accessibilty and decrease
                rate of errors.
