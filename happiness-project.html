          With a mission to heal, distract and get a few gnarly laughs, The Happiness Project is an
          atmosphere to find humor, journaling, stories, tips and distractions.

        	<dd>
            I’ve personally payed debt to my demons and wish for others to seek peace in those times. My vision was
            an environment where people can comfortably exist without judegment or toxic loopholes like social media. Play games, journal,
            talk to others, seek help and find comfort. That’s what The Happiness Project is about.

            We have all had nights, days, weeks or months that drown us in darkness. The Happiness Project is for
            those who are unable to itch or cope their way to contentment.

      <h5 class="text-left">Design</h5>
        <p>
          This little guy was one of the first server-side sites I had developed. My design background gave me an advantage
          when masterplanning the site layout and IA of the content. The real challenges were confronted when it came to server-side responsibilites.

      <h5 class="text-left">Develop</h5>

          The Happiness Project was developed using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP and MYSQL with opportunities like email sending, story writing & publishing, profile and account creation as well as
          journaling and gaming.
