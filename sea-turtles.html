                <p class="mb-5">
                  Save the Sea Turtles Foundation is a non-profit organization founded on Florida’s coast in 1987 aimed to support students, professionals and academic research efforts in the world of Marine Biology. With a specialization in sea turtles other marine life like sharks and jellyfish are also under their research umbrella.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Their mission and impact on our waters is incredibly powerful while their <a href="http://savetheseaturtle.org/default" target="_blank">current website</a> lacked this emotion. Especially since the foundation collects donations, runs a store and a membership program all from their website, it was due for a major refactor.

                  I love a chance to implement user-centered methodologies in projects and educating clients on how impactful 
                  a good design really is. As seen in the report above, the list of site issues is tremendous. To save you the 
                  trouble, here are some of the major pain points their current site occupied.
                </p>
                <ul class="mt-3">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Accessibility.</strong> The foundation caters to individuals of all ages. 
                    As you’ll soon see below, we interviewed two users out of many that support the foundation. 
                    One user was 20 years old and one was 62 years old. This age gap comes a variety of accessibility 
                    concerns like... <br/>
                     <span>
                      <strong>Color-blindness:</strong> mostly males of any age rely on high color contrast and iconography beyond basic color to differentiate site components
                      <br/>
                      <strong>Low-vision:</strong> young and old users can face poor vision
                      <br/>
                      <strong>High expectations:</strong> younger users are familiar with using quality applications in their day-to-day lives making it more noticeable when an application does not
                       meet those standards
                      <br/>
                      <strong>Keyboard-only usage:</strong> a website should be navigable without a mouse or it can be deemed unusable by visitors who rely on their keyboard
                     </span><br/><br/>
                     To combat this, we established a style guide with an AA-compliant color-palette, 
                     digitally readable typeface and high-quality, impactful imagery. 
                     <img
                     src="images/sea-turtles/assets.png"
                     alt="Color Palette and Typography"
                     class="img-fluid mt-5 mb-5"
                    />

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Emotion.</strong> A key aspect of non-profit organizations as seen with major societies like <a href="http://aspca.org" target="_blank">ASPCA</a>, 
                    <a href="http://sealegacy.org" target="_blank">Sea Legacy</a> and <a href="http://oceana.org" target="_blank">Oceana</a> is emotion. 
                    I wrote a content analysis case study specifically about the positive turn-around of emotional design.
                    <br/>
                    Large, emotional imagery is a common theme with websites conveying sentiment as well as colloquial 
                    language rather than technical talk. In user testing, an interviewee was put off by the site’s difficult-to-read 
                    academic verbiage.
                    <br/><br/>

                    <br/><br/>
                    <span class="text-gray min-font"><strong>Also to note</strong>: there was a lack of font hierarchy. The headings appear as 
                      if they were links and are the same font weight and size as the body text. The body text is bolded as well which 
                      makes it more difficult to read and differentiate blocks of text. The titles were shown in yellow 
                      which is inaccessible to classes of color-blindness on the blue background.</span>
                      <img
                      src="images/sea-turtles/poor-text.png"

                      class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-5"
                     />
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Four different sites.</strong> You read that right, the Foundation’s site is a combination of four 
                    different sites with different URLs. The user is unknowingly bounced around these multiple sites under the 
                    same roof with no way of going back. Not ideal.
                    <br/>
                    We proposed a new information architecture that housed all paths of the site under the same URL. 
                    This will then save the organization the cost of server space and audience loss.

                    <strong>Incorrect Components.</strong> Throughout the site there were components that acted as others which 
                    was a trend in past digital eras. This spoke to the dated-ness of the site.
                    <br/> 
                    Our solution relied on our object-oriented style guide with predefined components like buttons, 
                    input fields, navigation bars etc.

                <h1 class="mb-4 mt-10 text-primary">User Feedback</h1>
                <p class="mb-5">
                  To gather user-centered pain points that were scattered throughout the current site, we pulled two involved users. 
                  One of which was Rick, a 62-year-old father of a marine biologist. The other was Karey, a 20-year-old friend of a 
                  dedicated biology student.
                    <br/><br/>
                  We had them walk-through a real-life scenario of a task they would actually complete via the think aloud protocol. 
                  The results reiterated our findings and helped us focus on areas of improvement.
                </p>
                  <img
                    src="images/sea-turtles/Test_Personas.png"
                    alt="User Testing Results"
                    class="img-fluid mb-5"
                  />

                  <h1 class="mb-4 mt-10 text-primary">Responsive Design</h1>
                  <p class="mb-5">
                    The current site did not meet the digitally-responsive standards our devices now live in. That said, 
                    we designed interfaces that complimented viewports for small mobile phones, tablets and larger desktops 
                    alongside the common desktop size. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    Style guides and design systems make it pretty easy to mock up wireframes in higher fidelity. Especially since this 
                    site was information-heavy, building out wireframes with faux iconography and illustrations helped give me a better idea on 
                    whether or not to rework the brainstormed board.

                  <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5">Implementing the Style Guide</h4>
                  <p>
                    By incorporating our style guide and proposed IA, we found tasks were better completed and users were 
                    able to find what they needed about the organization. Our marketing strategist gathered quality images for the 
                    organization to legally include on their site. We used our colors, typography and components to bring the 
                    wireframes to life!
                  </p>

                  />
                  <p class="mt-5 mb-5">
                    We also included empty state and error page screens. Their current site lacked inline validation, 
                    feedback and error screens. We wanted to offer empty state screens if a user’s cart were empty, 
                    they send a message or they miss forget a form field.

                  In development, we provided an HTML/SASS/JS shell containing SASS partials of our style guide, 
                  helper classes, image assets and predefined design components. By providing the team a unique, 
                  object-oriented UI library, we can speed up the build process, save money and maintain a single, 
                  cohesive experience as planned.
