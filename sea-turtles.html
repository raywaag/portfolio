                Save the Sea Turtles Foundation is a non-profit organization
                founded on Floridaâ€™s coast in 1987 aimed to support students,
                professionals and academic research efforts in the world of
                Marine Biology.

                >
                lacks this emotion. Especially since the foundation collects
                donations, runs a store and a membership program all from their
                website, it was due for a major refactor.

              <p class="mb-5">
                Our discovery phase found itself deep in the weeds of a UX web
                audit followed by user feedback on the current site. We were
                then able to craft a suitable problem statement to aid our
                competitor analysis.

              <p class="mb-3 mt-3">
                In order to precisely define the problem statement, we had to
                run an audit.
                <strong
                  >This allowed us to pinpoint missing clarity, technical
                  issues, usability pitfalls and inaccessible practices.</strong

                To spare your time from reading the entire report, here are some
                of the <strong>major pain points identified</strong> from the
                audit:
              </p>
              <ul class="mt-4">
                <li class="mb-5">

                    ><span class="text-primary">Accessibility</span></strong
                  >
                  <br />The foundation caters to individuals of all ages. The
                  inaccessibility through out the site doesn't allow for an
                  inclusive experience and heavily contributes to the high
                  bounce rate.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Color Blindness</strong>: many color contrasts
                      failed to comply with WCAG across the site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Cognitive load</strong>: patterned background (a
                      true seen from the 90's) unfortunately painted the site's
                      corridors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Keyboard-only usability</strong>: very poor. It'd
                      be safe to say that users not relying on a mouse or
                      trackpad did not stay very long on this site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Mobile adaptability</strong>: to my surprise,
                      content did shift according to device size but... that's
                      about it.

                    titles - all popular styles throughout the site.

                  <br />
                  You read that right, the Foundationâ€™s site is a
                  <strong
                    >combination of four different sites with different
                    URLs</strong
                  >. And no, they don't link back to each other either.
                  <br /><br />
                  The user is unknowingly bounced around these multiple sites
                  under the same roof with no way of going back. Not ideal.

                  Throughout the site there were
                  <strong>components that acted as others</strong> which was a
                  trend in past digital eras. It showed the lack of time and
                  knowledge dedicated to the site and spoke to the dated-ness of
                  the site.
                  <br />
                  Our solution relied on a
                  <strong>component-oriented style guide</strong> with
                  predefined elements like buttons, input fields, navigation
                  bars etc.

                To identify user-centered pain points that were scattered

                We had them walk-through a scenario and analyzed the task
                completion via <strong>think aloud protocol</strong> followed by
                <strong>rating scale feedback</strong>. The results reiterated
                our findings and helped us focus on areas of improvement. Below
                are two snippets we pulled from the tests that heavily
                exemplified the current site's experience.

              <h3 class="mb-2 mt-10">The Problem Statement</h3>
              <p class="mb-3 mt-3">
                The Save the Sea Turtles Foundation is currently observing
                <strong>low audience conversion with quick bounce rates</strong>
                due to
                <strong
                  >poor website usability and a lack of organization
                  identity</strong
                >. To overcome the currently-outdated site and enhance its
                experience, the organization will undergo a
                <strong
                  >complete redesign in architecture and visual design as well
                  as define their brand</strong
                >. This will ultimately provide the
                <strong
                  >engaging, educational and inspirational experience</strong
                >
                that is desired by visitors.
              </p>

              <h1 class="mb-4 mt-10 text-primary">Design Phase</h1>
              <p>
                After establishing a ground for improvement, it was time to
                define the Save the Sea Turtles brand, create a style guide,
                re-vamp the site's architecture and begin to wireframe.
              </p>

              <h3 class="mb-2 mt-5">Proposing a new sitemap</h3>
              <p class="mb-5">
                As mentioned earlier, the site's architecture was chaotic. It
                bounced innocent users around four different sites with
                different designs and URLs.
                <strong
                  >It was easy to get lost within the tunnels of the
                  site</strong
                >. <br /><br />
                The first sitemap below is the original one - it speaks for
                itself.
                <br /><br />
                The next map is what we proposed. We found that the Shop was
                required to be a separate URL. To aid in lessoning confusion,
                <strong
                  >we opted to keep the same exact top navigation on both

              <p class="mb-4">
                In a rough total of <strong>20 hours</strong> and a
                <strong>handful of iterations</strong>, we crafted wireframes to
                be evaluated by our clients. This was a great opportunity to
                <strong
                  >ensure content was being represented properly throughout the
                  site and all ideated features were achievable in
                  development</strong
                >. <br /><br />
                <strong
                  >Our wireframe effort geared towards education and content
                  visibility</strong
                >. <br /><br />
                Below you'll see our toughest decision - the landing page.
                <strong
                  >We A/B Tested multiple different designs that prioritized
                  different content</strong
                >. Ultimately, we chose to use tabbed sections on the homepage
                to make all of the content available but only if the user was
                interested. By default, the landing page was to display the
                organization's mission.

              <p class="mb-5">
                Ross, our marketing strategist, and I teamed up to give Save the
                Sea Turtles Foundation a brand image
                <strong
                  >to give them a voice and consistent message across the site
                  and beyond</strong
                >. After finalizing the brand palette, Ross created a logo
                family and marketing plan while
                <strong>I began crafting a style guide</strong> from which we'd
                build. I was able to
                <strong>develop a UI library from the style guide</strong> to
                provide the developers with a
                <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a> guide
                to streamline their build.

              <h3 class="mb-2 mt-10">Implementing the Style Guide</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Style guides come in clutch!</strong>
                <br />
                It was essentially like applying a mini design system to bring
                the wireframes to life. After giving the wires some style, it
                was a game of content. Adding content to key pages ensured that
                we check all of the boxes like author pages and error feedback.
                Inline and apparent feedback was poor on the current site so it
                was very reassuring to build feedback states into the style
                guide.
