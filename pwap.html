                In a group of 4, we had three hours of the Adobe Competition to
                brainstorm, strategize, design and prototype an application
                under the theme of "Veteran Connections". We ended up winning
                second place and walking out with quite an accomplishment in a
                3-hour span. Additionally, all assets including the logo and
                photography were created by us.
                <br /><br /><br />
                Paws With A Purpose serves as a third party networking app to
                discover organizations that offer veterans service dogs with
                ease, simplicity and credibility.

              <p class="mb-5">
                The process of searching, discovering and reaching out to a
                service dog organization can be a complex, broad and uneasy
                journey. Paws With A Purpose is available to create a friendly,
                navigable environment for veterans to better understand and find
                organizations that are most suitable to them and their
                disabilities.
                <br /><br />
                Paws With a Purpose is for approved veterans seeking their
                fur-ever companion. Age range varies with a majority above 35
                years.
              </p>

              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>
                  Extensive research of the nation's service dog organizations,
                  their specialties and their selection processes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Knowledge of veteran disabilities, they're relativity,
                  commonality and the best options for those specific
                  disabilities.

                <li>
                  Within the design experience, the veteran's disabilities need
                  to be taken into account such as deafness and blindness.

                  PWAP is a visual experience. Images will be needed and
                  retrieved from different organizations.

                  supplied the images for the PWAP application.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h1 class="mb-2 mt-10 text-primary">Research</h1>
              <p class="text-gray min-font mb-4">
                (In the brief 3-hr time period we had)
              </p>
              <p>
                Research was heavily invested in service dog organizations and
                their specifics to better customize PWAP. This allowed the team
                to develop pathways specialized to the user's disability type.
                Our biggest market competitor is NAGDU Guide & Service Dog Info.
                We were able to analyze what aspects of the app they did well
                and what the user reviews liked / disliked about their app.
                Other service dog applications were accused of being falsified,
                leaving us a great gap in the market.
                <br /><br />
                A big issue NAGDU Guide & Service Dog Info faced was interface
                appearance. There was no graphical influence to their sitemap
                which allowed us a chance enhance our app in that area. Also,
                PWAP is an app specifically for veterans, therefore, our
                audience is very select allowing us to focus on catering to them
                and them only.

              <h1 class="mb-4 mt-10 text-primary">Key Pain Points</h1>
              <p class="text-gray min-font mb-4">
                The current presence of veteran service-dog resources
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Navigability was an issue with NAGDU Guide & Service Dog Info
                  mainly because, the outside user is unaware of the app's
                  depth. Discovering that there were only a few pages to the app
                  was frustrating and deceiving.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This effected the usability of the app as well given that the
                  information was not absorbed in an efficient fashion due to
                  the user's now maddened state of mind.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No focus. Once graduated and ready to serve, service dogs are
                  categorized into their best-fit roles. That is, hearing,
                  guide, facility, etc. In our architecture, we knew we wanted a
                  way for veterans to find a companion quicker. To do this,
                  narrowing down their specific disability improves the intimacy
                  of the product and provides a more efficient experience for
                  our users.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The current market applications are information-heavy. They
                  are appropriate for user's in search of laws and regulations
                  regarding service dogs. Then again, you do not need an app for
                  that.

              <h1 class="mb-4 mt-10 text-primary">
                Considering the Fundamentals
              </h1>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Time on task.</strong> continuous clicks, scrolls and
                  questions can repel a user, leaving them ineffectively
                  informed and leaving the app without users. To achieve an
                  organized, timely application, PWAP consisted of clear and
                  evident icons and buttons with the ability to reach the menu
                  or go "back" at any time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Error Rate.</strong> A seemingly obvious but easily
                  overlooked component of the design and development is the rate
                  of errors. It is vital for PWAP users to encounter a user
                  experience wit correct paths, formatting and back-end ability.
                  <br />
                  The design needs to promote effortless navigation. So that the
                  user can answer where they are, where they came from and where
                  they need to go next.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Retention Rate.</strong> this will also allow the user
                  to recognize where they are within the app sitemap. Headers
                  reminding the user where they are will ease their recognition
                  of location in the app. For instance, if they select deafness
                  as their disability, they'll meet a list of potential service
                  dog organizations with a page header reminding them they
                  selected deafness. Likewise, when they proceed and select an
                  organization, they will be directed to the organization's PWAP
                  "profile" in which the organization they are viewing will be
                  evident.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>User Enjoyment.</strong> a very important fundamental
                  to the app's design is the user's enjoyment. Creating a
                  visually appealing interface that includes infographics and
                  imagery along with principal data will capture the user's
                  amusement and compel them to continue the use of PWAP.
                </li>
              </ul>

                >This is a note of reflection on the application and
                improvements that could be made. Essentially, it's a UX audit on
                my own app.</span
              >
              <p class="mt-5">
                There are a few things immediate hit my eye when reflecting on
                this application. A big one that I have since then come to care
                about immensely is accessibility.
                <br /><br />
                Especially for an application serving users with physical,
                mental and situational disabilities, there are major flaws in
                some areas. Grant it, in the alloted timeframe I don't blame us
                for considering these issues but they should still be confronted
                and will be right now.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Good use of iconography</strong>
                <br />
                First of all, I applaud our then chaotic and stressed brains for
                considering the use of iconography with text. Icons-only can be
                misleading and text-only can be under-visual.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Bad consideration for color</strong>
                <br />
                It was a quick decision to <i>not</i> use red, white and blue as
                that palette is very clichè in veteran material. But had we
                really looked into a color palette that met design system
                standards, we could've achieved greater contrast in key areas of
                the application. <br />
                There is a light blue-grey used throughout the application for
                captions, taglines and support text that is almost invisible. To
                a color-blind user or visitor with low-vision, this text would
                be useless. <br />
                The star ratings on organization profiles are also too light.
                Their contrast does not meet ADA Compliance and would need to be
                refactored.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Too little padding on touchpoints</strong>
                <br />
                Specifically, I found this issue on screens where the back arrow
                sits a bit too close to the hamburger menu. Being a mobile app,
                the user should have enough room to avoid mishaps. As a majority
                of veterans are men, these touchpoints are meeting larger
                fingers. This should have been considered.
                <br />
                Speaking of space, considering the application's "safe area" and
                bordering margins could've prevented some of the content running
                so close to the edge of the screen.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Centered nav links</strong>
                <br />
                This is less of an accessibility issue and more of a design
                enhancement, but I have come to appreciate the function of
                left-aligned data and lists. As the navigation menu is
                essentially a list, it would perform and appeal better if the
                text links were aligned left.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Close button?</strong>
                <br />
                When a hamburger menu opens, it is common for the user to expect
                a close button. In our application, the hamburger menu goes
                unchanged. Ideally, when the menu is activated that hamburger
                icon should shift into a close icon. Additionally, the words
                "menu" and "close" should be implemented here to inform the user
                of their capable actions.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Logout</strong>
                <br />
                In many scenarios of UX it's important to emphasize destructive
                actions, I first learned this when studying the iOS interface
                and have used this rule consistently in HCA Healthcare
                applications. That said, the "Logout" button within the
                navigation menu should be signified with color and a
                confirmation alert. That way users know the permanence of the
                action.

                All in all, I am really pleased with my team's ability to
                conjure an idea, strategize the workflow and engage appealing
                design in such a short time. This was my second Adobe UX Design
                Competition (we received second place in both competitions) and
                it is such a thrill to not only consider pleasing UI design but
                also a strategize that catches the judges eyes and workflow that
                <i>actually</i> signifies an excellent user experience.
