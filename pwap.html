                      Research was heavily invested in service dog organizations and their specifics to better customize PWAP. This allowed the team to develop pathways specialized to the user's disabilty type. Our biggest market competitor is NAGDU Guide & Service Dog Info. We were able to analyze what aspects of the app they did well and what the user reviews liked / disliked about their app. Other service dog applications were accused of being falsified, leaving us a great gap in the market. A big issue NAGDU Guide & Service Dog Info faced was interface appearance. There was no graphical influence to their sitemap which allowed us a chance enhance our app in that area. Also, PWAP is an app specifically for veterans, therefore, our audience is very select allowing us to focus on catering to them and them only.

                      <p>Firstly, it is important to note that an app with the capabilities of PWAP has yet to exsist on the market.
                      The research comparisions we made were based on the most similar applications.</p>
                      <li>Navigability was an issue with NAGDU Guide & Service Dog Info mainly because, the outside user is unaware of the app's depth.
                      Discovering that there were only a few pages to the app was frustrating and deceiving.</li>
                      <li>This effected the usability of the app as well given that the information was not absorbed in an efficient fashion
                      due to the user's now maddened state of mind.</li>
                      <li>The current market applications are information-heavy. They are appropriate for user's in search of laws and regualtions regarding
                      service dogs. Then again, you do not need an app for that.

                  We used yellows and blues to achieve feasibility within a patriotic envirnment. We did not want to overtly use red, white and blue. We found that yellow paired well with the brighter blues and sustained a professional stance. Our primary audience is above the age of 35 years, hence big fonts and icons designed to increase accessibilty and decrease the rate of errors.

              <ul>
                <li><span class="significant">Time on task:</span> continuous clicks, scrolls and questions can repel a user, leaving them ineffectively informed and leaving the app without users.
                <br>
                To achieve an organized, timely application, PWAP consisted of clear and evident icons and buttons with the ability to reach the menu or go "back" at any time.</li>
                <li><span class="significant">Error Rate:</span> A seemingly obvious but easily overlooked component of the design and develpoment is the rate of errors. It is vital for PWAP users
                to encounter a user experience wit correct paths, formatting and back-end abiltiy.
                <br>
                The design needs to promote effortless navigation. So that the user can answer where they are, where they came from and where they need to go next.
                <li><span class="significant">Retention Rate:</span> this will also allow the user to recognize where they are within the app sitemap. Headers reminding the user where they are will
                ease their recognition of location in the app. For instance, if they select deafness as their diability, they'll meet a list of potential service dog orangizations with a page header reminding them they
                selected deafness. Likewise, when they proceed and select an organization, they will be directed to the organization's PWAP "profile" in which the organization they are viewing will be evident.</li>
                <li><span class="significant">User Enjoyment:</span> a very important fundamental to the app's design is the user's enjoyment. Creating a visually appealing interface that includes infographics and imagery
                along with principal data will capture the user's amusement and compell them to continue the use of PWAP.</li>
