                      Clusterizr's mission is to ease and strengthen the local connection of UCF students & alum with local companies in the tech industry.
                      <br />
                      On a team of UX engineers, designers, developers, and marketing specialists, Clusterizr came to life with a "by students, for students" motto. 
                      Leading the UX team to create progressive wireframes, models, sitemaps and prototypes was an amazing, productive experience.

                      Clusterizr's inital proposall was a combination of Linkedin, Indeed, Ziprecruiter and UCF Handshake. But, of course, better. More responsive, better feedback, visually 
                      appealing, navigable. That said, before the design sprints, the team spent about a week and a half to conduct user analyses on current market sites. 
                      These included those listed above as well as JobCase, MyOpportunity, Glassdoor, Snagjob and Monster.

                    <ul>
                      <li><span class="significant">Asynchronous loading.</span> As popularity of the AJAX, on-page loading is rising, we found it to be beneficial to job seeker sites as it increases 
                        user retention on where they are. The user shouldn't be stuggling to navigate Clusterizr. Our pages were never quite deep enough for breadcrumbs nor did we feel 
                        that would be an effective execution of information architecture.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Logged out job seaching.</span> Some tested sites were inaccessible to the point where the user could not move until they creted an account or logged in. This is not a 
                        welcoming introduction of a company and we decided to make job searching (not job saving or applying) a task the user could whether they were logged in or not.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Simplicity.</span> Finding a job is a hectic task in itself. Why would you want a messy environment to support that? As the unformation architects, we used only the space we 
                        needed to display data.</li>

                      List of problematic featues and elements that interfered with the user experience.

                    <ul>
                      <li><span class="significant">Responsiveness.</span> Modern development should go without saying but responsiveness should always, always, always be factored into design. In some cases, a mobile-first 
                        approach is necessary as a site may contain a lot of data that needs to fit on a mobile interface.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Design diversity.</span> UX Designers have their intention in the name - to enhance the <i>user experience</i>. A dull, repetitve design from page to page is not a way to enthuse the user nor does it 
                        invite them back. Using graphics, background shapes, gradients and font differentiations, the team created boards that were not <i>too</i> disconnected, but also brought variety to Clusterizr.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Navigation.</span> There is innovative design and then there is just plain poor design. Some analyzed sites lacked navigational features very important to user interaction. It seemed as though it was an 
                        app modernization gone wrong. Clusterizr and all its glory <i>needed</i> proper naivagtion.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Overwhelming footers.</span> Why a footer <i>needs</i> to be a novel is beyond me. Nesting the unnecessary routes that are in a lengthy footer can save space and appear less overwhelming to the viewer.</li>

                  <p>These features were integral to the design of Clusterizr.</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li><span class="significant">Navigability.</span> Clusterizr is an advanced system including job/resume searches, postings, applications, user/company profiles, newsfeeds and a message center. It's vital that 
                        the user can get anywhere from anywhere and know exactly how to do that. A poor navigation system = a lost and unhappy user.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Customization.</span> A home to a user's professional network should feel controlled. Clusterizr gives that control to the user to add, delete or alter connections and information about themselves. 
                        Profiles should not be forced onto users. Adding more or less is completely objective and we wanted our young professionals to feel represented in the atmosphere of Clusterizr.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Connectability.</span> Messages, connections, disconnections, networks, applications - it's all a way for the student (& alumni) to reach the companies and visa versa. Since that heavily stands in Clusterizr's 
                        mission, it was a prioritized that these connections feel simple, fearless and accessible to execute.</li>
