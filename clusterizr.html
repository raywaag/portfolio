                  Clusterizr's mission is to ease and strengthen the local
                  connection of UCF students & alum with local companies in the
                  tech industry. On a team of UX engineers, designers,
                  developers, and marketing specialists, Clusterizr came to life
                  with a "by students, for students" motto. Leading the UX team
                  to create progressive wireframes, models, sitemaps and
                  prototypes was an amazing, productive experience.

                <p class="mb-5">
                  Clusterizr's initial proposal was a combination of Linkedin,
                  Indeed, Ziprecruiter and UCF Handshake. But of course,
                  better: more responsive, better feedback, visually appealing,
                  navigable. That said, before the design sprints, the team
                  spent about a week and a half to conduct user analyses on
                  current market sites. These included those listed above as
                  well as JobCase, MyOpportunity, Glassdoor, Snagjob and
                  Monster.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Asynchronous loading.</strong> As popularity of the
                    AJAX's one-page loading is rising with SPAs, we found it to be
                    beneficial to job seeker sites as it increases user
                    retention on their location within the application. The user shouldn't be struggling
                    to navigate Clusterizr. Our pages were never quite deep
                    enough for breadcrumbs nor did we feel that would be an
                    effective execution of information architecture.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Logged out job searching.</strong> Some tested sites
                    were inaccessible to the point where the user could not navigate the site
                    until they created an account or logged in. This is not a
                    welcoming introduction of a company and we decided to make
                    job searching (not job saving or applying) a task the user
                    could perform whether they were logged in or not.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Simplicity.</strong> Finding a job is a hectic task
                    in itself. Why would you want a messy environment to support
                    that? As the information architects, we used only the space
                    we needed to display data.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="mt-5">The Not So Great Angles</h4>
                <span style="color:#888;font-size:0.95em;"
                  >Market features that interfered with the experience.</span

                  <li>
                    <strong>Responsiveness.</strong> Modern development should
                    go without saying but responsiveness should always, always,
                    always be factored into design. In some cases, a
                    mobile-first approach is necessary as a site may contain large-scale 
                    data that needs to fit on a mobile interface.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Design diversity.</strong> UX Designers have their
                    intention in the name - to enhance the user experience. A
                    dull, repetitive design from page to page is not a way to
                    enthuse the user nor does it invite them back. Using
                    illustrations, background shapes, gradients and font
                    differentiations, the team created boards that were not 
                    disconnected and brought variety to Clusterizr.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Navigation.</strong>There is innovative design and
                    then there is overworked design. Don't reinvent the wheel. 
                    <br/>
                    <i>Don't fix what ain't broke.</i>
                    <br/>
                    Some analyzed sites lacked navigational features very important to user
                    interaction. It seemed as though it was an app modernization
                    gone wrong. Clusterizr and all its glory needed proper
                    navigation. Simplicity is rising in popularity so much that designers 
                    sometimes forget to consider the application's actual usability.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Overwhelming footers.</strong>Why a footer needs to
                    be a novel is beyond me. Nesting the unnecessary routes that
                    are in a lengthy footer can save space and appear less
                    overwhelming to the viewer.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Visual Design</h2>
                <p class="mb-5">
                  The University of Central Florida has a great style guide that
                  we were able to apply. UCF's palette codes and fonts were
                  beneficial to the outcome of Clusterizr's design. Whether the
                  users <i>consciously</i> realize it or not, they know they are home.

                    these have in common? Modern simplicity.
                    <br />
                    Facebook lent us a boilerplate to a simple, marketed
                    interface while also obtaining many features. Clusterizr was
                    able to materialize an interface that mastered white space
                    and emphasized significant actions.

                    <strong>Message allowance.</strong> Even when designing for
                    recruiters, we were still designing for students. A huge
                    complaint from students and even current employees (in
                    reference to LinkedIn) was the ample amount of unnecessary
                    recruiting messages they received. For one, I can relate.
                    But two, what could we do about this? Recruiters are just
                    doing their job but at what cost? Not accommodating the fact
                    that the recruiters position and student's interests are
                    vastly different?
                    <br />
                    It was a fair agreement that recruiters should be more
                    informed about what their open position entails and the
                    actual skills and interest of the student. But since we
                    can't design for that, in our beta testing we are allotting
                    an allowance of recruitment-specific messages. Recruiters
                    are then able to post or privately message about their job
                    position. UX isn't just about design. It's abut human
                    behavior and strategy.

                    <strong>Searching.</strong> a large part of a recruiter's
                    job is searching and finding. To accompanying this, we
                    established a recruiter-centered search and result system
                    that allowed them to narrow down candidates, find standouts
                    in their field of recruitment and ensure that not only the
                    process is efficient, but also the results were suitable.

                    <strong>Muscle Memory.</strong> Upon testing the Facebook
                    interface with Clusterizr in mind, when marked all actions
                    that were categorized as "muscle memory". Human Factors
                    encompasses the user's mental memory of actions with
                    technological experiences. Without even knowing it, human's
                    rely on these subconscious gestures to complete
                    technological tasks.

                    In this bucket falls movements like scanning the top of the
                    page for search bars, eyes jumping to the top right or the
                    left-column of feeds to find their profile, familiar faces
                    and advertisements on the right-most column etc. All sound
                    familiar?

                    <strong>Who's got time for that?</strong> Students are busy.
                    Students are lazy. And students <i>really</i> appreciate
                    their free time away from the books. So enters the question:
                    <br /><br />

                    love with filtering, connect with a click and navigate their
                    messages seamlessly were a few of the answers we found to
                    minimize the fear and hassle of, essentially, a
