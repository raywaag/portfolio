              <p>
                MyDisneyToday (MDT) thrives on business collaboration. In the early months following launch, our product team took the lead
                on business configurations and updates through the ServiceNow ("native") portal. This native experience was incredibly unintuitive and 
                required a consistent learning curve. Because of its complexity, it also meant only a few people knew how to use it and reliance on their expertise was 
                eating away their time. Since the initial launch focused on delivering the MVP, the Business Admin Console quickly followed as a key next step. It gave us the 
                opportunity to showcase the customization we could implement in-product while also introducing a user-friendly interface to support 240,000 employees world-wide.
                What follows is an overview of that console and how it supports MDT's scalability.
              </p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Without the Admin Console</h2>
              <p class="mb-3">
                  The biggest struggles we faced without an admin console were:          
                </p>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>
                  <strong>Dependency on experienced users</strong> - Only a few experts (me, my manager, and one analyst) managed business configurations and updates instead of focusing on their core work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Lack of self-service tools for business users</strong> - This customization was the first step in displaying how MDT could evolve into a CMS for our business partners to 
                  empower them instead of creating dependency on the product team (us).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Time diverted from product priorities</strong> - Supporting configuration needs pulled time and focus away from critical product development tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Increased accuracy</strong> - The native console made it too easy to make mistakes or unintended releases due to its lack of usability.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Opportunities</h2>
              <p class="mb-3">
                This introduced a series of opportunities that drove our admin tool experience:
              </p>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>
                  <strong>Reduce product team overhead</strong> - Shifting configuration to a seamless and simple experience, frees up the product team to focus on core innovation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Accelerate content deployment</strong> - Editing, previewing, and updating could be done in a few easy steps rather than tackling the data-driven native console.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Introduce scalable self-service</strong> - This could signify to business and leadershuo that self-service could be launched in MDT to 
                 reduce operational friction and scale better with growing business needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Invest in purpose-built admin tools</strong> - Building dedicated tooling supports long-term efficiency and reduces reliance on workaround platforms.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary mt-10">Research & Discovery</h1>
              <h3 class="mb-2 mt-5">Business Needs</h3>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Because MyDisneyToday delivers a tailored experience for employees across various businesses and regions, it was
                essential to provide flexibility to curate content. This included the ability to customize
                navigation and homepage widgets to better serve the needs of specific employee groups.
              </p>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>
                  <strong>Everything in One Place</strong> - Searching, applying, and application tracking should
                  live in a single place.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Poor Communication</strong> - Reaching out to recruiters, teams, and hiring managers
                  can be undependable via email alone.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Visual Hire Timeline</strong> - Visually convey where candidates are in the process
                  along with the status of their application.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Job Suggestions & Recruitment</strong> - Suggest open roles based on job preferences and allow
                  employees to open themselves to recruitment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Communication Preferences</strong> - Offer multiple forms of reliable communication for
                  employees to ensure correspondence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Single-Click Application</strong> - With Workday profiles, resume uploads, portfolio links,
                  and more, applications can be much more streamlined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Role Transparencyn</strong> - Make employees aware of a roleâ€™s job level, salary,
                  flexibility type, team, and hiring manager.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="mb-2 mt-5">Proposed Workflow</h3>
              <p class="mb-4">
                If not careful, this admin tool could have quickly turned into a web of links, tabs, pages and confusion. I set up a portal workflow to 
                provide an intuitive and simple way to access <i>specific</i> content quickly and seamlessly publish updates.
              </p>

              <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary mt-12">Creating the Experience</h1>
              <p class="mb-4">
                We have third-party developers as part of the MDT product team. I worked with them to transform the native ServiceNow experience 
                into one that was usable and required very little training. These are the implementations designed and developed to invite business collaboration.
              </p>

              <h2 class="mt-5 mb-2">List Views</h2>
              <p>
                The first page you'd see entering the admin console is a list of business entity configurations. This name carried over from legacy development but really refers to each 
                targets' business experience.

                The BEC-level hierarchy received the most iterations due to its possibilities and complexity. We needed to keep it as simple as possible while offering 
                the most efficient layout.

                  <strong>Important Information</strong> - Also targeted per location, region, and business, the important information card came to be through COVID as news had to be promoted and "pinned" 
                  to employee bulletins such as vaccine information and workplace flexibility guidelines.

              <h4 class="mt-10">Top Navigation</h4>
              <p>
                Top navigation was one of the few places businesses could brand MyDisneyToday. To uphold accessibility compliance, we didn't allow for too much color customization. 
                Top navs could be given background colors and text colors. This went through our approval to maintain an accessible contract on the navigation bar.

                <li>
                  <strong>Text color</strong> - After implementation of the MyDisney design system and dark mode, this option became a dropdown of only curated colors.

                  <strong>Preview</strong> - Something I really despised about the native console was the lack of knowing. When designing the front-end console, it was important to add

              <p>
                The left navigation panel offered limited customization. We provided businesses with a section of navigation to make their own. Links that did not change were those such as 
                News, Events, Resources, My Account, and Help.

                  <strong>Multi-level link management</strong> - The left navigation had a hierarchy of Nav Panel > Main Menu > Sub-links. It was important to know what was being edited and

                The footer rarely changed. Unless businesses were added, removed, or renamed, the footer was essentially set from launch. However, we needed a way to make adjustments as needed.
