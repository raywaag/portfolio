                Disney’s internal site, Belong, recognizes Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) for employees & cast members through stories, events,
                spotlights, Business Employee Resource Groups (BERGs), DEI education, and enterprise-wide DEI initiatives.
                <br><br>
                However, it has a strong potential to better engage employees, harness the power of BERGs through content and membership, consolidate amongst the numerous other DEI portals across 
                the company, and allow for greater opportunity to belong at Disney.

                Belong impacts all Disney employees world-wide, giving it a broad user demographic. To
                define personas, we focused on these 4 user scenarios:
              </p>
              <ul class="mb-3">
                <li><strong>The New Employee</strong>is still learning the ropes of the company.</li>
                <li><strong>The Researcher</strong> continuously browsing and searching for community.</li>
                <li><strong>The Community Member</strong> desires active involvement in BERGs and community.</li>
                <li><strong>The Community Leader</strong> leads BERGs and DE&I initiatives.</li>

              <p class="mb-5">
                This analysis allowed us to define what existed
                and why it was necessary. It included a journey through all DE&I sites that existed around the company to support 75+ BERGs and
                individual DEI business and brands like National Geographic, Hulu, and Pixar. These sites were most
                commonly hosted on Sharepoint and Disney’s Intranet but also leveraged vendor servers.
                <br><br>
                I audited the sites and their content to identify similarities. What were things we could pursue as a
                company-wide resource? How could we enhance discoverability? How can we connect with these businesses & brands instead of persisting in silos? 
                <br><br>
                At a high level, it became clear that these items existed on every standalone DEI site across Disney:
              </p>

                <p>📰 DEI News and Events</p>
                <p>📚 Educational Content</p>
                <p>🗓️ Annual Heritage & Recognition Calendars</p>
                <p>☕ Executive Coffee Talks - small group DEI discussions with leaders</p>

              <p class="mt-3">
                <strong>Current Journeys</strong><br>
                Having identified our key personas and their needs, we measured Belong’s success through storyboarding current
                experiences for each persona and identified where the pain points exist.

                <strong>Ideal Journeys</strong><br>
                Those current storyboards exposed a series of pain points. We considered potential solutions to solve for those
                pain points and created a series of ideal storyboards to rectify those journeys.

              <p>
                After creating and evaluating the ideal storyboards, we identified the advantages:

              <p class="mt-3">
                As mentioned above, Disney has over 75 BERGs across the company. The BERGs serve criteria for business, location, and these 9 dimensions:
              </p>
              <ul class="mb-3">
                <li>Asian American / Pacific Islander</li>
                <li>Black / African American</li>
                <li>Disabilities</li>
                <li>Hispanic / Latinx</li>
                <li>Jewish</li>
                <li>LGBTQ+</li>
                <li>Multicultural</li>
                <li>Muslim</li>
                <li>Native American / Indigienous</li>
                <li>Veterans / Military</li>

              />

              <p class="mb-5">
                In each dimension there are many, different groups from across over the world under different businesses.
                <br><br>  
                There are also a number of “Affinity Groups” at Disney which are ae entirely other project and story on their own.
                <br><br>
                If you’re overwhelmed, that’s normal. The goal of reconfiguring the architecture of BERGs was to ensure
                the paths to each BERG were clearly defined and the workflow of joining a BERG was seamlessly crystal clear.
              </p>

              <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary mt-12">Design Phase</h1>

              <h3 class="mt-5">Designing an Immediate Solution</h3>
              <p class="mb-2">
                We were really excited to brainstorm blue sky designs for Disney DEI. But first, we needed to establish a short-term
                solution for Belong. How could we use MyDisneyToday, our newly-launch employee experience platform, to better support the Belong site where it currently lived?
                <br><br>
                Over time, Disney’s Belong site became an unorganized melting pot of links and content with no real prioritization. A site
                that should be simple, just wasn’t.
                <br><br>
                With that potential to meet simplicity, I pulled out key items within the site such as Disney’s Historically Black
                Colleges & Universities (HBCUs) initiative, <a href="https://reimaginetomorrow.disney.com" target="_blank">the Reimagine Tomorrow Digital Hub</a>, DEI Events, upcoming coffee talks, and
                of course Disney’s BERGs to be highlighted on MyDisneyToday until we could move them all into MyDisneyToday in the future.
                <br><br>
                The BERGs received their own section organized by dimension and visually represented by “Diverse Mickeys” that have since gained much recognition and even live 
                on DPEP's HUB site as well!
              </p>
              <img
                src="images/belong/belong-diverse-mickeys.png"
                alt="Diverse Mickeys"
                class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-3 br"
              />

              <p class="mt-3 mb-3">
                Along with this content began our long journey of representing the DEI initiatives of our business’ such as Studios,
                ESPN, DMED, and DGE. They received their own space that we worked with them to build out.
              </p>

              <h3 class="mt-10">BERG Flow Testing & Design</h3>
              <img src="images/belong/berg-abc-testing.png" alt="BERG A/B/C Test Flows" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-5 br" />
              <p>
                We had established our short-term solution for BERGs WHICH at least offered SOME organization and
                direction for employees but we weren’t sure how employees preferred to find a BERG. Was it by business? By location? By
                dimension? All of the above? If it was all of the above, what is the best flow we could offer to employees searching for
                a BERG?
                <br><br>
                This was a prime opportunity to create a few prototypes
                and put them in front of actual users. I created three different paths and we ran an A/B/C test which quickly became an
                A/B test after we started to see a trend in testing.
              </p>
              <img src="images/belong/berg-flows.png" alt="BERG Journey Flows" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-3 br" />
              <img src="images/belong/berg-flows_2.png" alt="BERG Journey Flows" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-3 br" />
              <img src="images/belong/berg-flows_3.png" alt="BERG Journey Flows" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-5 br" />
            
              <p>
                Test A won with flying colors. Although it has more clicks, it most accurately followed the employee mental model
                of searching for a new BERG:
                <br><br>
                Dimension → Location → BERG Page
                <br><br>
                This also opened the door for dimensions to have their own page to host shared content and individual BERGs to have
                their own pages to leverage events, announcements and more.
                You’ll see a theme here - we want to empower BERGs as much as possible to extend their breadth and offer employees
                the best possible communities with a sense of belonging in an easy way.
              </p>


              <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3">Defining Content & IA</h3>
              <p>
                We had a short-term plan that was actually more of a bandaid. So how could we create a new, unique experience for Belong
                that solved for the defined pain points and also receive buy-in from Disney leadership? Enter: The Magic Wand.
                <br><br>
                My team and I entered a sea of “what ifs” and threw all the pasta at the wall. Some ideas we went into blind, others we
                could leverage Belong site analytics and past research to weigh its potential. After 5 days of ideation sessions and
                many, many plates of spaghetti we landed on the following:
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><strong>A unique landing page</strong>, not just a link farm, for BERGs, heritage months, Disney initiatives
                and a call-out for DEI stories, content, events and ways to get involved.</li>
                <li><strong>DEI Around the Businesses tab</strong> which carried over from our short-term solution.</li>
                <li><strong>BERG</strong> solutions that reflected usability lab results and catered to an effortless "join a BERG" worklofw.</li>
                <li><strong>Education & Support tab</strong> that not only linked to featured DEI learnings but also featured a DEI glossary and
               Disney partnerships such as Glaad, NAACP, Ascend, Anita B and more.</li>
                <li><strong>Disney’s DE&I Initiatives</strong> received a new space to authentically showcase Disney's iniatives like Disney On The Yard, Onyx Collective, and 
                  Black Talent Network.</li>
                <li><strong>Get Involved tab</strong> that featured ways employees could get involved such as Affinity Groups, Clubs,
                Mentorships, VoluntEARing, internal DEI job postings and other programs.</li>
                <li><strong>Contact Us form</strong> which, believe it or not, this page did not exist on Belong. Instead there was a small, hard-to-find “Feedback”
                link. This new page would offer not only a form but also FAQs and quick links.</li>
              </ul>

                We were lucky enough to work with our partners at Lucasfilm (Belonging @ Lucasfilm), Pixar (The Pixar Wiki), and Hulu (The Huluverse) to walk through demos of their portals and DE&I presence. 
                <br><br>
                Each demo was uniquiely different upon learning what worked and what didn't work for those businesses. We leveraged this information to form 
                the following takeaways for our own enterprise-wide DE&I efforts.
              </p>
              <ul class="mt-5 mb-3">
                <li>Centralizing information & content under one digital roof is beneficial for our employees.</li>
                <li>Integrated communication forums do not perform against competitors like Slack, Teams and Yammer.</li>
                <li>Hertiage months can be a means of celebration and education depending on how they're promoted to employees.</li>
                <li>There are many ways to engage employees through modals such as playlists, virtual murals, and interactive events!</li>
                <li>Giving BERGs their own space to empower their voice and communications is critical.</li>
                <li>Beyond employees and BERG members, there are opportunities to lay foundation for DE&I practitioners as well.</li>
              </ul>



              <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary mt-12">The Final Designs & Prototype</h1>
              <p>
                Now the fun begins with the flexibility to instate new experiences that didn't yet exist on the MyDisneyToday platform.

              <p class="mt-5">
                I went through many design iterations, pushing the bar further and further with each delivery.
                <br><br>
                After long hours of mixing, matching, and creating new layouts, we landed on a design that both we as a team and
                our immediate stakeholders were pleased with. We used these designs to propose this new strategy to DEI leadership. I
                also designed a portal for DEI practitioners within MyDisneyToday and a landing page design that represented how the
                Belong team could leverage this platform.              
              </p>


              <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary mt-12">Getting Executive Buy-In</h1>
              <p>
                With a fresh, new look and architecture for Belong in our prototype, we then had to develop a strategy and presentation
                to gain executive buy-in. Our directors and project manager worked to hone in on a clear plan while I developed visuals
                to support them. These concept visuals represented the strategy and how it tied into
                Disney’s business goals.
              </p>
              <img src="images/belong/belong-dlr-visual.png" alt="Disneyland Resort Visual" class="img-fluid mt-3 br" />
              <p class="mt-5">
                We presented so many times I think I could recite it by memory. Everyone LOVED IT. Our idea of a unified strategy was a huge success and only gained traction as more and
                more leaders heard about it.
                <br><br>
                As a part of our strategy, we needed a larger headcount. This meant some internal shifting and may require some new
                hires as well. A PAR document was created and so it begins. It will be a handful of months before actual development is
                to kick-off but we are now a train traveling full speed ahead.
