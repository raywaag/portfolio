            <h3>The My Account Experience</h3>
            <p>
              Previously, employee resources were scattered across multiple platforms, making it difficult to find perks, tools, and
              essential settings. With MyDisneyToday, we brought everything together into one seamless, easy-to-use hub—powered by
              smart backend integrations that keep the experience smooth, efficient, and up to date.

              <p class="mb-5">
                MyDisneyToday's flexibility and customization offered a chance to incorporate HR products into the platform experience and further streamline employee needs, goals, and connection. This prototype 
                became a concept design distributed to leadership across multiple departments. <br/>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Pain Points</h2>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Networking, finding information, subscribing to news, updating settings, and view perks were all impacted by the following obstacles:
              </p>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>
                  <strong>Multiple Touchpoints</strong> - Employees often couldn't find resources, requested support, or carried multiple bookmarks in order to find simple 
                  information such as pay, perks, and PTO.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Lack of Networking Opportunities</strong> - Connecting with employees across Disney was inhibited by the lack of options to connect. This would often 
                  be done through email or Teams since there was no way to save contacts with vital partners.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Redundant Steps</strong> - Employees weren't aware of who owned what information - pay vs. perks vs. benefits vs. IT. And we wouldn't expect them to know. 
                  We needed a solution to bring everything together so that, regardless of what they understood, they had exactly what they needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Inconsistent Experiences</strong> - Since multiple departments owned various resources, most sites required different interactions.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Opportunities</h2>
              <p class="mb-3">
                We had a great starting point by identifying glaring issues while staging for employee interviews. These were the initial opportunities we promoted for the effort.
              </p>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>
                  <strong>Everything in One Place</strong> - Jobs, learning, connection, settings, HR resources, and IT tools all in one place.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Visualization</strong> - We had the unique opportunity to not only pull in data but also optimize it's visual experience to make information 
                  available <i>and</i> understandable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>MyDisneyToday integration</strong> - With everything in one portal, we could integrate features to include them into notifications and search results.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Personalization</strong> - This new design could give employee's the chance to make it their own as you would with an actual workspace.
              </ul>

              <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary mt-10">Current Experience</h1>
              <h3 class="mb-2 mt-5">Current Employee Account</h3>
              <p class="mb-4">
                As it stood, the account page felt uninviting and offered limited functionality. The primary interaction point, 
                'Subscriptions' tab, was largely overlooked. In fact, UX research revealed that many employees didn’t even realize it was
                there.

              <h3 class="mb-2 mt-5">Proposed Employee Account</h3>
              <p class="mb-4">
                After the following journey, the final proposal consisted of connections, interactive employee information, career tracking, perks viewing, and site configurations.

              <h3 class="mb-2 mt-5">Round 1</h3>
              <p>
                The first round was to get an initial pulse on the project and determine if it's worth the effort. We introduced a few preliminary concepts.
              </p>

              <p>
                The second round of research focused on details within the sauce. After confirming high-level needs in round one, we could then dive into the interactions and resources 
                that lived within the profile.

              <p>
                This round again focused on specific resources and perspectives that required employee understanding. We also introduced the concept of a careers portal within 
                the account experience.

              <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">What Employees Want</h3>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Recognizing that employees have aspirations and interests beyond just their basic needs, we introduced cards that
                highlight community and well-being resources—like clubs, recognition programs, and exclusive perks.

              <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3">What Employees Need</h3>
              <p class="mb-4">
                By listening to employee feedback, we prioritized the tools they truly needed—like connection features, org charts, PTO
                details, and access to employee information.
              </p>

              <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3">Incorporating Career</h3>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Career and internal mobility were ongoing hurdles for employees. It was difficult to find new jobs, connect with recruiters, and plan career trajectory through 
                offered learnings. The introduction of My Account offered an opportunity to incporoate career development into employee profiles.

              <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3">Learning & Development</h3>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Alongside career, learning and development resources were vary inconsistent across businesses while Disney offered many learning opportunities at the 
                enterprise level that were available to everyone. In the account space we could design a way for learning tracks, courses, and planning to feed into the 
                interface to allow employees to engage in their development.

              <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary mt-10">In Conclusion</h1>
              <p class="mb-4">
                In reimagining the employee account experience, we aimed to turn fragmented systems into a unified, intuitive hub—one that
                empowers employees to connect, grow, and access what they need all in one place. By grounding every feature in real
                feedback and blending what people both need and want, the platform isn’t just functional—it’s meaningful. With this
                foundation laid, it’s exciting to think of the future possibilities: smarter personalization, deeper career pathways,
                and an even more connected Disney community.
