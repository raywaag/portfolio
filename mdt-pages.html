              <p>
                MyDisneyToday thrives on business collaboration. In the early months following launch, our product team took the lead
                on business configurations and updates through the ServiceNow ("Native") portal which pulled us away from our core responsibilities. These
                were tasks we always intended to empower our partners to manage themselves. Since the initial launch focused on
                delivering the MVP, the Business Admin Console quickly followed as a key next step. What follows is an overview of
                that console and how it supports self-service and scalability.
              </p>
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Without the Admin Console</h2>
              <p class="mb-3">
                  The biggest struggles we faced without an admin console were:          
                </p>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>
                  <strong>Dependency on the product team (us)</strong> - The product team was managing business configurations and updates instead of focusing on their core work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Lack of self-service tools for business users</strong> - Business teams couldn’t independently manage their content or settings, creating dependency on the product team.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Time diverted from product priorities</strong> - Supporting configuration needs pulled time and focus away from critical product development tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Lack of empowerment for business partners</strong> - The needs of unique brands across Disney are rightfully high. But meeting all of the for everybody with just one 
                  small team was not productive and required a solution.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Opportunities</h2>
              <p class="mb-3">
                This introduced a series of opportunities that drove our admin tool experience:
              </p>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>
                  <strong>Reduce product team overhead</strong> - Shifting configuration ownership to business users frees up the product team to focus on core innovation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Accelerate content deployment</strong> - Reaching out to recruiters, teams, and hiring managers
                  can be undependable via email alone.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Empower business partners</strong> - Providing the right tools allows partners to manage their own configurations, increasing agility.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Introduce scalable self-service</strong> - A self-service model reduces operational friction and scales better with growing business needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Invest in purpose-built admin tools</strong> - Building dedicated tooling supports long-term efficiency and reduces reliance on workaround platforms.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary mt-10">Research & Discovery</h1>
              <h3 class="mb-2 mt-5">Business Needs</h3>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Because MyDisneyToday delivers a tailored experience for employees across various businesses and regions, it was
                essential to provide our brands with the flexibility to curate their own content. This included the ability to customize
                navigation and homepage widgets to better serve the needs of their specific employee groups.
              </p>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>
                  <strong>Everything in One Place</strong> - Searching, applying, and application tracking should
                  live in a single place.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Poor Communication</strong> - Reaching out to recruiters, teams, and hiring managers
                  can be undependable via email alone.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Visual Hire Timeline</strong> - Visually convey where candidates are in the process
                  along with the status of their application.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Job Suggestions & Recruitment</strong> - Suggest open roles based on job preferences and allow
                  employees to open themselves to recruitment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Communication Preferences</strong> - Offer multiple forms of reliable communication for
                  employees to ensure correspondence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Single-Click Application</strong> - With Workday profiles, resume uploads, portfolio links,
                  and more, applications can be much more streamlined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Role Transparencyn</strong> - Make employees aware of a role’s job level, salary,
                  flexibility type, team, and hiring manager.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="mb-2 mt-5">Proposed Workflow</h3>
              <p class="mb-4">
                If not careful, this admin tool could have quickly turned into a web of links, tabs, pages and confusion. I set up a portal workflow to 
                provide an intuitive and simple way for businesses to access <i>their</i> content quickly and seamlessly publish updates.
              </p>
              <img src="images/disney-mdt/bec-sitemap.jpg" alt="Disney Profile Career Portal" class="img-fluid br" />
              

              <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary mt-12">Creating the Experience</h1>
              <p class="mb-4">
                We have third-party developers as part of the MDT product team. I worked with them to transform the (absolutely awful) native ServiceNow experience 
                into one that was usable and required very little training. These are the implementations designed and developed to invite business collaboration.
              </p>

              <h2 class="mt-5 mb-2">List Views</h2>
              <p>
                The first page you'd see entering the admin console is a list of business entity configurations. This name carried over from legacy development but refers to each 
                targets business experience. For security, it's critical that businesses only work on configurations that they own - introducing permissions. Showing and hiding features 
                depending on user levels allowed us to simplify the list view and get content managers where they needed to go as quickly as possible.
              </p>
              <img src="images/disney-mdt/bec-list-views.png" alt="Disney Profile Career Portal"
                class="img-fluid br" />



              <h2 class="mt-10 mb-2">Editing a BEC</h2>
              <p>
                Once an admin is inside their business configuration, they can edit various aspects of their site - such as the top navigation, left navigation, footer, and homepage cards, or widgets, to include 
                resources, events and news.
              </p>

              <!-- Homepage Cards -->
              <h4 class="mt-5">Homepage Widgets</h4>
              <p>
                MyDisneyToday has a dyanmic homepage. Employees can edit their widgets to create a workspace that suits them. 
                These widgets include business-specific conetnt such as Featured News, Upcoming Events, and Resources. Other widgets that don't require business involvement are 
                Disney Stock, Learning & Development, Groupd & Clubs, and Employee Recognitions.
              </p>
              <h5 class="mb-3">Requirements</h5>
              <ul class="mt-3 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>Default Cards</strong> - Businesses are able to establish the initial layout of their homepage, before an employee moves, adds, or removes widgets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Default Reources</strong> - Like cards, default resources are set by businesses to establish a productive start to an employee's first visit to MDT - an attempt 
                  to give them what they need prior to customization.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Upcoming Events Card</strong> - The Events card was targeted per business and region. Employees would only see events they can attend.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Featured News</strong> - Each business had one or more news feeds. On the Featured News card for each business, their would be default feeds. This typically included 
                  the business or regional feed plus some enterprise subscriptions like Disney Today and Corporate Socialability. Employees could then unsubscribe to default feeds or subscribe to 
                  new feeds themsevles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Important Information</strong> - Also targeted per location, region, and business, the important information card came to be through COVID as news had to be promoted and "pinned" 
                  to employee bulletins such as vaccine information and workplace flexibility guidelines.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <!-- Top Navigation -->
              <h4 class="mt-10">Top Navigation</h4>
              <p>
                Top navigation was one of the few places businesses could brand MyDisneyToday. To uphold accessibility compliance, we didn't allow for too much color customization. 
                Top navs could be given background colors and text colors. This went through our approval to maintain an accessible contract on the navigation bar.
              </p>
              <h5 class="mb-3">Requirements</h5>
              <ul class="mt-3 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>Logo</strong> - Locked and remained the "MyDisneyToday" logo, only changed for the year of Disney's 100th anniversary in 2023.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Text color</strong> - After implementation of the MyDisney design system and dark mode, this option became a dropdown of only curated colors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Background color</strong> - Businesses updated this to stamp their brand onto MyDisneyToday
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Preview</strong> - Something I really despised about the native console was the lack of knowing. When designing the front-end console, it was important to add 
                  in featured so admins could view their work as they go.

              <!-- Left Navigation -->
              <h4 class="mt-10">Left Navigation</h4>
              <p>
                The left navigation panel offered limited customization. We provided businesses with a section of navigation to make their own. Links that did not change were those such as 
                News, Events, Resources, My Account, and Help.
              </p>
              <h5 class="mb-3">Requirements</h5>

                <li>
                  <strong>Main menus</strong> - The highest level were the main menus that expanded to offer additional links.

                <li>
                  <strong>Multi-level link management</strong> - The left navigation had a hierarchy of Nav Panel > Main Menu > Sub-links. It was important to know what was being edited and 
                  to design that flow thoughtfully.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Link information</strong> - After organizaing the main menus, links required fields to define the link names, URLs, icons, and targeting.

              <!-- Footer -->
              <h4 class="mt-10">Footer</h4>
              <p>
                The footer rarely changed. Unless businesses were added, removed, or renamed, the footer was essentially set from launch. However, we needed a way to make adjustments as needed.
              </p>
