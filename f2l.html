              Flight2Landing was an..interesting project. I came into as the
              Lead UX Designer mid-way. I wasn't involved in the initial
              architecture, the market matrix comps, the style guide - or the
              lack there of.
              <br />
              <br />
              This posed as a pretty imediate issue. After trying to salvage
              what had already been mocked and iteratively developed, a complete
              overhaul was the ultimate solution. This included backtracking to
              meet proper UX navigability, A11Y accessible practices, data
              visualization, brand change and a concrete style guide.
              <br />
              <br />
              We also had a pretty steady in-and-out of interns and workers.
              This made for inconsistent workflows and, again, a timely detail.
              Alas, here we go.

              I call this section 'The Mud' because that's what it felt like to
              trudge through the mess of the current architecture and turn
              around to explain to the stakeholders why these worked. But, they
              didn't. This ultimately caught us in a bind and it was time to
              time-travel beyond the last few months of work.
              <br /><br />
              This cost money, time and confidence. <i>This</i> is one of the
              many reasons why proper UX design is important. Emphasis on the
              UX.

              There were quite a few problems here. But, first, we must tackle
              the name of the game - user experience. This means designing
              interfaces that are accessible, comprehensible, and error-free
              with minimal task time.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="significant">Inaccessible Palette.</span>
                For starters, there was no palette. Inspecting these screens
                outputted up to 18 different colors used through out the
                application. The first step was recognizing key colors: Primary,
                Secondary, Error, Success, Diabled and extended colors for
                states of interaction. Then, color combinations had to meet A11Y
                accessibilty to accompany viewability across all users like the
                color blind. This tremendously lightens the style guide and
                helps the developers establish specific color variables to use.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="significant">Site Architecture.</span>
                A huge disability of this interface was the inappropriate
                sub-navigation tabs through out the application. In what seemed
                as a tactic to "save space" was a clutter and complicated
                roadmap that only seemed to steer the user further and further
                from their goals. Tabs are good. Tabs on tabs on tabs are not.
                Proper side navigation drawers and separated application
                sections assisted this issue in the end.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="significant">Compartments gone wild.</span>
                When there are multiple interactive boxes and compartments on a
                single page, it can be overwhelming and unproductive to the
                user.It is difficult to look at collage of sections and know
                what to do or even what you <i>can</i> do.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="significant">Zig-Zagging viewing pattern.</span>
                In many facets of design, it's essential to design for the
                viewer's scanning eye. There are key directions at which the
                user's eye flows through out art and even more so an app. The
                initail designs did not satisfy proper vision flow and therefore
                it was stressful and incompetent as an interactive interface.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="significant">Inconsistent Typography.</span>
                Typography is powerful and syntactical. It has meaning and
                purpose in the areas in resides and the outcome of its location
                effect not only the look but also the development of the site.
                The primary desings had headings as body text and headings as
                tags and visa versa and then some. Needless to say, a pattern
                had to be established. Alongside this issue was the use of
                multiple typefaces in accidental locations. I'd like to think
                this was a faulty outcome of muliple designers stepping in at
                different times of the process and <i>not</i> working together.

                Beyond the headaches and long hours of the site reconfiguration,
                there were benefits to walking into a project like this. The
                users are in a margin in which I fall under, that said, when I
                came fresh into this project and struggled to use it, I couldn't
                imagine what an outside user must feel. Hence, user testing.
                Multiple iterations of prototype testing evolved into the
                screens you have sen above. And that, my friends, was only the
                cusp.
