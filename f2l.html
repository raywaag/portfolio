                <p class="mb-5">
                  To start, let me just say, UX auditting is one of my favorite
                  things. Not that I love to savagely comb through below par
                  interfaces, but UX audits are an opportunity to teach the
                  client and even business partners proper usability and
                  accessibilty standards as well as conveying the importance of
                  UX to them. Typically in these instances, if an audit is all
                  that is asked, I'll deliver a set (small or large depending on
                  the project) of design comps and a written copy of all
                  interface modifications made and why.
                  <br /><br />
                  Flight2Landing was an interesting project. I came into as the
                  Lead UX Designer mid-way. I wasn't involved in the initial
                  architecture, the market matrix comps, the style guide - or
                  the lack there of.
                  <br /><br />
                  This posed as a pretty imediate issue. After trying to salvage
                  what had already been mocked and iteratively developed, a
                  complete overhaul was the ultimate solution. This included
                  backtracking to meet proper UX navigability, A11Y accessible
                  practices, data visualization, brand change and a concrete
                  style guide.
                  <br /><br />
                  We also had a pretty steady in-and-out of interns and workers.
                  This made for inconsistent workflows and, again, a timely
                  detail. Alas, here we go.
                </p>

                <h2>My Roles</h2>

                <h2 class="mb-3">Let's get started</h2>
                <p class="mb-5">
                  I call this period 'The Mud' because that is what it felt like
                  to trudge through the mess of the current architecture and
                  turn around to explain to the stakeholders why these worked.
                  But, they didn't. This ultimately caught us in a bind and it
                  was time to time-travel beyond the last few months of work.
                  <br /><br />
                  This costs money, time and business support. This is one of
                  the many reasons why proper UX design is important. Emphasis
                  on the UX.

                <span style="color:#888;font-size:0.95em;"
                  >There were quite a few problems here. But, first, we must
                  tackle the name of the game - user experience. This means
                  designing interfaces that are accessible, comprehensible, and
                  error-free with minimal task time.</span

                    <strong>Inaccessible Palette.</strong> Well, there was no
                    palette. Inspecting these screens outputted up to 18
                    different colors used through out the application. The first
                    step was recognizing key colors: Primary, Secondary, Error,
                    Success, Diabled and extended colors for states of
                    interaction. Then, color combinations had to meet A11Y
                    accessibilty to accompany viewability across all users like
                    the color blind. This tremendously lightens the style guide
                    and helps the developers establish specific color variables
                    to use.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Site Architecture.</strong> A huge disability of
                    this interface was the inappropriate sub-navigation tabs
                    through out the application. In what seemed as a tactic to
                    "save space" was a cluttered and complicated roadmap that
                    only seemed to steer the user further and further from their
                    goals. Tabs are good. Tabs on tabs on tabs are not. Proper
                    side navigation drawers and separated application sections
                    assisted this issue in the end.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Compartments gone wild.</strong> When there are
                    multiple interactive boxes and compartments on a single
                    page, it can be overwhelming and unproductive to the user.It
                    is difficult to look at collage of sections and know what to
                    do or even what you can do.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Respect the Z.</strong> In many facets of design,
                    it's essential to consider the viewer's scanning eye. There
                    are key directions at which the user's eye flows through out
                    art and even more so an app such as "The Z". The initail
                    designs did not satisfy proper vision flow and therefore it
                    was stressful and incompetent as an interactive interface.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Inconsistent Typography.</strong> Typography is
                    powerful and syntactical. It has meaning and purpose in the
                    areas in resides and the outcome of its location effect not
                    only the look but also the development of the site. The
                    primary desings had headings as body text and headings as
                    tags and visa versa and then some. Needless to say, a
                    pattern had to be established. Alongside this issue was the
                    use of multiple typefaces in accidental locations. I'd like
                    to think this was a faulty outcome of muliple designers
                    stepping in at different times of the process and not
                    working together.
                  </li>

                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Re-Design</h2>
                <p class="mb-5">
                  The site re-skin was aimed towards hitting all of the key pain
                  points listed above and ensuring that the site meets maximum
                  usability standards through simple and effective user
                  protoyping. Responsive design like handheld mobile views for
                  tablets and smartphones were also added to the re-desgin
                  collection. Initially, we used Adobe XD but eventually shifted
                  to Sketch and Invision for ideal testing scenerios.
                  <br /><br />
                  This switch ultimately eased the bridge from design to
                  development and encourage conversation through out the entire
                  team.

                <p class="mb-5">
                  Beyond the headaches and long hours of the site
                  reconfiguration, there were benefits to walking into a project
                  like this. The users are in a margin in which I fall under,
                  that said, when I came fresh into this project and struggled
                  to use it, I couldn't imagine what an outside user must feel.
                  Hence, user testing. Multiple iterations of prototype testing
                  evolved into the screens you have sen above. And that, my
                  friends, was only the cusp.
