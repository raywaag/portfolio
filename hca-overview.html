        <p>
          Flight2Landing was an..interesting project. I came into as the
          Lead UX Designer mid-way. I wasn't involved in the initial
          architecture, the market matrix comps, the style guide - or the
          lack there of.
          <br />
          <br />
          This posed as a pretty imediate issue. After trying to salvage
          what had already been mocked and iteratively developed, a complete
          overhaul was the ultimate solution. This included backtracking to
          meet proper UX navigability, A11Y accessible practices, data
          visualization, brand change and a concrete style guide.
          <br />
          <br />
          We also had a pretty steady in-and-out of interns and workers.
          This made for inconsistent workflows and, again, a timely detail.
          Alas, here we go.
