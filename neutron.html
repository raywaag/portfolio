                What is a design system and why have a team dedicated to
                maturing it? A design system is a collection of components
                within a brand family or style guide equivalent. The system is
                shared amongst designers and developers to streamline their
                workflow, create company-wide collaboration and manage
                consistency. With a design system comes research, continual
                advancements and front-end engineering.
                <br /><br />
                The best way to explain it is LEGOs! There is a massive amount
                of pieces that go into building the Millennium Falcon out of
                LEGOs, for instance. These pieces are differentiated by colors,
                shapes and sizes. The Falcon wouldn't look right if it were
                built with a rainbow of parts, would it? Especially in the
                foreground of

                  gunmetal and dark-toned palettes</a
                >. I'll admit, the image below is quite impressive. But the
                time, effort and money taken to complete it does not meet its
                potential.

                The Millennium Falcon may still fly but it would be hardly
                recognizable. The same goes for a digital presence. A company
                with digital products built from an inconsistent UI would, as
                well, be hardly recognizable.
                <br /><br />
                A design system is similar to having an organized collection of
                LEGOs to use for a variety of gadgets.

                Along with consistency comes time. An elongated project roadmap
                would be required to forage all of the right components in
                assembly of the Millennium Falcon. Wouldn't it be convenient to
                have a pre-defined set of pieces unique to constructing the
                Falcon? To have all of the integrants properly colored and
                sorted with directions on how to use them? Exactly, I thought so
                too. Hence, a design system.

                and deep-dive it later. Essentially, it breaks down a design
                system of components into levels for easier implementation and
                organization. The chunking method at its finest! Atoms are the
                smallest (let's not go sub-atomic right now). Molecules are the
                middle-ground and often made up of atoms. Finally, organisms are
                the largest components created by atoms and molecules.

              <p>
                It's a component-centered approach that provides easier
                comprehension for designers and a more structured system for
                developers. It's basically built off of itself! That's some cool
                beans.

                Neutron has placed me on a team of rockin' individuals who
                advocate software design, human-computer methodologies and the
                psychology about why interface designs are the way that they
                are.

                The responsibility of educating colleagues about designing
                applications can be daunting and refuted by others. However, I
                love this practice and embrace it as an opportunity to learn
                more about the cognitive psychology of interface design and how
                to best supply research in support of any design decisions made.

                  <strong>Component-centered research.</strong> I once heard
                  "Design without data is simply an opinion." This is more so
                  emphasized when business partners or clients begin to question
                  design decisions. Market analyses, A/Bs, usability testing,
                  user surveys and pattern discovery result in the informative
                  ability to justify our design system. Research also gives us
                  as designers the direction to move forward.

                  <strong>Documentation.</strong> We know how important
                  documentation is to the end-users of our design system. I'll
                  talk more about it in the following section. Leveraging the
                  above component-centered research and feedback from our user
                  surveys, we crafted a documentation site that is already
                  making a difference. As Neutron grows, the more necessary it
                  is to have an organized, educational space in which it is
                  dedicated.

                  <strong>Design system rollout to existing products.</strong>
                  Administering 1:1's and auditing current applications takes
                  time but is extremely satisfying. It's a serious form of
                  meditation! After re-skinning a product with Neutron, there is
                  unanimous acclamation. A visual representation of what an app
                  could look like can quickly get business and developers on
                  board for adapting the design system. Below is a complete
                  website overhaul leveraging the Neutron design system if you'd

                  <strong>Consulting.</strong> Neutron is being implemented
                  across the company and even by third-party vendors! This is
                  very exciting. We engage in feedback reviews for these
                  "Neutronees" to help guide the use of the kit, design
                  implementation and accessibility. Watching the wave of Neutron
                  continuously expand to reach company-wide products is

                  <strong>Bridge between design & development.</strong> It's
                  important that Neutron's codekit adheres to the design
                  system's guidelines including anatomy, usage and interactions.
                  I had a blast setting up Neutron's components in
                  <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a> to
                  demonstrate the animation and structure of the components.

                  <strong>Initial codekit builder & current co-creator.</strong>
                  Neutron's development library began as an HTML/CSS/JS kit. We
                  built through version 1.2 of Neutron's responsive web system
                  until coming to the realization that there is a missed
                  opportunity, per se, in an HTML kit. While many developers
                  were using the library and established an engaged community
                  around Neutron Dev, framework developers using React or Vue or
                  Angular were at a loss and suffered from code bloat when
                  implementing Neutron.
                  <br />
                  They needed a modular approach. We have since then
                  open-sourced Neutron within the company to build out a
                  <a href="https://stenciljs.com/" target="_blank">StencilJS</a>
                  code library that can be pulled in any format needed from HTML
                  to React to Vue.<br />

                  <strong>Resources.</strong> A one-stop shop is a good term for
                  it. While working with teams and external parties, having this
                  central location provides the ability to download brand fonts
                  and design system libraries without a handful of links (before
                  refactoring our entire documentation site we had
                  <i>literally</i> 7 different links).<br />

                  <strong>Component usage.</strong> As the core Neutron team, we
                  receive a lot of inquiries about how a component should be
                  implemented in different use-cases. Researching and
                  documenting usage practices for each component makes it easy
                  for designers to find answers and present these solutions to
                  business partners.<br />
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <strong>Component best practices.</strong> Design systems are
                  wonderful and so easy to execute but they can also be easy to
                  manipulate. Best practices are beneficial to document in the
                  case that a component is poorly implemented. This is where the
                  dos and don'ts make their debut.<br />

                  <strong>Development resources.</strong> Not to be ignored,
                  development documentation is crucial. Like

              <p class="mb-4">
                Rolling out a design system across a large organization takes
                patience. Popping into engineers' product roadmaps for a "UI
                update" isn't bought too easily. Providing a visual difference
                with the design system gives product teams tangible
                encouragement to begin UX refactors. Sometimes I will build an
                HTML/CSS shell with the design system to give engineers some
                reference and confidence is re-skinning an entire product.

              <p class="mb-5">
                Once our design system grew a bit more from initial components,
                typography, grid system and brand strategy, it still needs
                ongoing maintenance. We are fortunate to have a
                multidisciplinary team of researchers, designers, engineers and
                management working together to keep our design system fit and
                mature.
              </p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Continuous Research</h2>
              <p class="mb-5">
                Experience designers don't shy away from research. We are
                familiar with practices and standards defined by research
                studies we perform.
                <br /><br />
                Documenting components alone calls for component-based research
                that encapsulates best practices, usages, anatomy and
                accessibility. With that comes A/B tests for component design
                and templates in which we use
                <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/" target="_blank"
                  >UserTesting</a
                >. User and benchmark tests are also released to gather feedback
                from Neutron's users. This helps us identify any gaps or issues
                in the system.
              </p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Continuous Design</h2>
              <p class="mb-4">
                I'd like to emphasize the amount of persistent design that
                occurs in the development of a design system. Updates in design
                tools and operating systems happen often. Sometimes an update in
                your design tool may throw some things out of whack, causing the
                need for some rework. Operating systems as well undergo updates.
                If you have design kits for iOS and/or Android devices like
                Neutron does, then the team needs to adapt to continual updates
                those systems release.

              <p class="mb-3">
                Thus far, we've begun to transition Neutron's HTML/CSS code kit
                to a
                <a href="https://stenciljs.com/" target="_blank">StencilJS</a>
                library. With web components, the code can be pulled in any
                format needed such as HTML, React, Vue etc. This solution seems
                to be the most scalable so far, especially across such a large
                company.

                Neutron has an exciting roadmap ahead. We have come a long way
                and yet have a long way to go. New developments in other kits
                like 10ft views and Android are to come while also adapting a
                voice & sound strategy for conversation design. We also have a
                weighted work log for engineers like releasing the iOS SDK,
                completing the Stenciltron (StencilJS + Neutron) project, and
                beginning Android development.
                <br /><br />
                Neutron will continue spreading throughout the digital presence
                of HCA Healthcare as we build, manage, research, document and
                advocate for it.
