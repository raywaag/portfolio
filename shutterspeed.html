                      Shutterspeed efficiently connects clients and photographers within location, price range and photographic genre. With Shutterspeed, photographers can profile themselves, showcase their work, present testimonials and connect with clients. Similarly, clients can post jobs, search and find photographers within their area and budget as well as have profiles and contact photographers.

                      Freelance photographers, like many small business entrepreneurs, face the obstacles of promotion and advertising while also developing a brand for themselves, connecting with their clients efficiently and doing so without fraudulent data. Photographers often have to rely on third-party applications such as Facebook or Instagram to connect with potential clients and showcase their work. This gives an unfair advantage to the more “popular” photographers, leaving other very skilled photographers in the dark. Shutterspeed treats everyone equally and is not based on ratings or popularity. Clients also may have a difficult time finding a photographer that suits them and their specs especially if they are not social media users. Word of mouth and a good SEO website is all they have in their toolbox.

                      ShutterSpeed's market competitors include Shootster, Care.com and SnapShot. Think aloud Protocals were executed during hierarchical task analyses. Through this research we found key ways to decrease error rates and time on task and increase enjoyment and retention rates. Exhibiting more graphical content and less verbaige with simple, clear pathways executing immediate user feedback were a prioritizations needed in the designer phase of the site. Other fixes include proper functionality (accurate code maps), large mobile icons and detailed descriptions to avoid misinformation.

                      <li><span class="significant">Outdated site information and users.</span> A big issue with related sites are their seeming ability to stay up to date.
                      A client reaching out to an inactive photographer will not service anyone. ShutterSpeed will phase out accounts upon their inactivity.
                      Unlike Care.com and Shootster, some site designs are very outdated as well. Photography is a technical profession and if there is not a corresponding technical site, users
                      may be led to believe that ShutterSpeed has a lack of mastery and skill in teh field and therefore are not credible. You shouldn't judge a book by
                      its cover, yet everyone does.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Too much verbaige.</span> It is possible for a site to be very word-heavy. Just like a magazine page or social media post, visuals with too many
                      words are often overlooked. Especially as a photography site, our mission for ShutterSpeed was to create an environment with congregating colors and esteemed images.
                      </li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Catering to the wrong audience.</span> As said before, ShutterSpeed is geared towards both photographers <i>and</i> clients.
                      Some sites have a landing page that say "Need a photographer?" in large text and, of course, a jumbotron. But waht about the clients? This lead us to base our design more on
                      Care.com's landing page that greets the user with options like a fork in the road...Photographers go this way, clients go with way.</li>
                      <li><span class="significant">Photographer-specific.</span> Besides the key factors that would make ShutterSpeed successful by design, there are not many freelance-friendly sites that cater
                      specifically to photographers. This gives us a good gap in the market to comfortably reach victory.</li>

      <p>Images. Images lead a great deal of our design methods. Gallery sections, photographer highlights and features photographs were

                            <p>A hierarchical task analysis was performed on competitor, Care.com, to better understand the alterations that
                              needed to be made or features to include in order for ShutterSpeed to reach its utmost success.</p>
                            <li><span class="significant">Time on task:</span> In user testing, Care.com's amount of questions when it came to hiring a caretaker
                            was very time-consuming. On top of that, the site feedback was inaccurate, leaving the user misinformed and misdirected. The user would have benefited more from a
                            questionnaire with less verbaige, a greater opportunity to "choose all" and more accurate feedback.</li>
                            <li><span class="significant">Error Rate:</span> This lead us to another finding of errors. Care.com had errors with button feedback which wasted time and frustrated the user.
                            To avoid errors, ShutterSpeed's development would need to be detailed, accurate and user-friendly.</li>
                            <li><span class="significant">Retention Rate:</span> Care.com did well at letting the user know where they were and how they got there. Our plan with ShutterSpeed and it's filtering capablitiy upon searches
                            (adding and deleting filters as well) would give us the means of reminding the user of where they are and why they are there.</li>
                            <li><span class="significant">User Enjoyment:</span> Care.com's use of color, size and wording give the user experience praise. Simple. Apparent. Alluring. Those design
                            qualities make the user want to keep exploring deeper into the site.</li>

            <br><br>
            Let's say you are a photographer and you log in, you are then taken to your profile and the navigation bar is altered to display
            settings, messages and log out icons. From here, you can view any unread messages from clients or other photographers, read reviews people have

            <br><br>
            As a client, you can search for your photographer for instance under the "wedding" genre and you'll be presented with results. These results can then
            be filtered by location, budget and genre as well.
            <br><br>
            By scrolling through the results, you can find the photographer that best suits your needs, view their profile and send a message their way.
